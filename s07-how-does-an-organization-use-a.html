    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch03_p01">Cindy Hall is the owner and chief executive officer of SailRite Company. SailRite builds two models of sailboats that are sold at hundreds of retail boat showrooms throughout the world. At its inception several years ago, the company produced only the Basic model, which is 12 feet long and designed for two sailors. Very few options are available for this model, and the production process is relatively simple. Because many owners of the Basic model wanted to move to a bigger, more sophisticated boat, SailRite developed the Deluxe model two years ago. The Deluxe model is 14 feet long and designed for three sailors. Many additional features are available for this model, and the production process is more complex than for the Basic model. Last year, SailRite sold 5,000 units of the Basic and 1,000 units of the Deluxe.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch03_p02">Although sales of both models increased last year over the year before, company profits have steadily declined. Cindy, the CEO, is concerned about this trend and discusses her concerns with John Lester, the company’s accountant; Mary McCann, the vice president of marketing; and Bob Schuler, the vice president of production.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch03_p03">This dialogue between the accountant and top management emphasizes the importance of having accurate cost information for decision-making purposes. Very few costing systems provide “perfect” product cost information. Overhead (indirect manufacturing costs) can be allocated in a number of different ways and result in a number of different costs for the same product. The goal is to find a system of allocation that best approximates the amount of overhead costs caused by each product. Sophisticated costing systems are expensive, however. Organizations like SailRite must continually ask the question: Will the benefits of having improved cost information outweigh the costs of obtaining the information?</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch03_p04">Several options are available to allocate overhead costs. Before we discuss these options, it is important to understand why overhead costs are allocated at all.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch03_s01_p01"><em class="emphasis">Question: Recall that costs for direct labor and direct materials are easily traced to products. When SailRite produces a sailboat, the direct materials include items such as fiberglass to build the hull, mast, sails, and rope. Direct labor includes the employees building the boat. Accounting for these costs is fairly simple. Indirect manufacturing costs (also called manufacturing overhead or overhead) include electricity to run the factory, rent for the factory building, and factory maintenance. These costs are not easily traced to products and pose a much more complicated challenge for SailRite. Accounting for indirect manufacturing costs typically requires allocating overhead using predetermined overhead rates. </em><em class="emphasis bolditalic">Why do managers insist on allocating overhead costs to products?</em></p>
    <p class="para block"> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch03_s01_p02">Answer: Three important reasons that managers allocate overhead costs to products are described in the following:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch03_s01_l02">
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Provide information for decision making.</strong> Setting prices for products is one example of a decision that must be made by management. Prices are often established based on the cost of products. It is not enough to simply include direct materials and direct labor. Overhead must be considered as well.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Promote efficient use of resources.</strong> Several different activities are performed to produce a product, such as purchasing raw materials, setting up production machinery, inspecting the final product, and repairing defective products. All of these activities consume resources (consuming resources is another way of stating that a cost is associated with each of these activities). If products are charged for the use of these activities, managers will have an incentive to be efficient in utilizing the activities.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Comply with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (U.S. GAAP).</strong> U.S. GAAP requires that all manufacturing costs—direct materials, direct labor, and overhead—be assigned to products for inventory costing purposes. This requires the allocation of overhead costs to products.</li>

When </em><em class="emphasis bolditalic">Hewlett-Packard </em><em class="emphasis">produces printers, the company has three possible methods that can be used to allocate overhead costs to products—plantwide allocation, department allocation, and activity-based allocation (called activity-based costing). </em><em class="emphasis bolditalic">How do managers decide which allocation method to use?</em></p>
    <p class="para block"> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch03_s02_p02">Answer: The choice of an allocation method depends on how managers decide to group overhead costs and the desired accuracy of product cost information. Groups of overhead costs are called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">cost pools</a><span class="glossdef">A collection of overhead costs, typically organized by department or activity.</span></span>. For example, <strong class="emphasis bold">Hewlett Packard’s</strong> printer production division may choose to collect all factory overhead costs in one cost pool and allocate those costs from the cost pool to each product using one predetermined overhead rate. Or <strong class="emphasis bold">Hewlett Packard</strong> may choose to have several cost pools (perhaps for each department, such as assembly, packaging, and quality control) and allocate overhead costs from each department cost pool to products using a separate predetermined overhead rate for each department. In general, the more cost pools used, the more accurate the allocation process.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch03_s02_s01_p01"><em class="emphasis">Question: Let’s look at SailRite Company, which was presented at the beginning of the chapter.

The predetermined overhead rate is calculated as follows (from <a class="xref" href="heisinger_1.0-ch02#heisinger_1.0-ch02">Chapter 2 "How Is Job Costing Used to Track Production Costs?"</a>):<span class="informalequation"><math xml:id="heisinger_1.0-ch03_m001" display="block"><semantics><mrow><mtext>Predetermined overhead rate</mtext><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mrow><mtext>Estimated overhead costs</mtext></mrow><mrow><mtext>Estimated activity in allocation base</mtext></mrow></mfrac></mrow></semantics></math></span>When activity-based costing is used, the denominator can also be called <em class="emphasis">estimated cost driver activity</em>.</span> One cost pool accounts for all overhead costs, and therefore one predetermined overhead rate is used to apply overhead costs to products. You learned about this approach in <a class="xref" href="heisinger_1.0-ch02#heisinger_1.0-ch02">Chapter 2 "How Is Job Costing Used to Track Production Costs?"</a> where one predetermined rate—typically based on direct labor hours, direct labor costs, or machine hours—was used to allocate overhead costs. (Remember, the focus here is on the allocation of overhead costs. Direct materials and direct labor are easily traced to the product and therefore are not a part of the overhead allocation process.)</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch03_s02_s01_p04">Using SailRite Company as an example, assume annual overhead costs are estimated to be $8,000,000 and direct labor hours are used for the plantwide allocation base. Management estimates that a total of 250,000 direct labor hours are worked annually. These estimates are based on the previous year’s overhead costs and direct labor hours and are adjusted for expected increases in demand the coming year. The predetermined overhead rate is $32 per direct labor hour (= $8,000,000 ÷ 250,000 direct labor hours). Thus, as shown in <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch03_s02_s01_f01">Figure 3.1 "Using One Plantwide Rate to Allocate SailRite Company’s Overhead"</a>, products are charged $32 in overhead costs for each direct labor hour worked.</p>

Assume direct materials cost $1,000 for one unit of the Basic sailboat and $1,300 for the Deluxe. Direct labor costs are $600 for one unit of the Basic sailboat and $750 for the Deluxe. This information, combined with the overhead cost per unit, gives us what we need to determine the product cost per unit for each model.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch03_s02_s02_p02">Answer: The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">department allocation</a><span class="glossdef">A method of allocating costs that uses a separate cost pool, and therefore a separate predetermined overhead rate, for each department.</span></span> approach is similar to the plantwide approach except that cost pools are formed for each department rather than for the entire plant, and a separate predetermined overhead rate is established for each department. Remember, total estimated overhead costs will not change. Instead, they will be broken out into various department cost pools. This approach allows for the use of different allocation bases for different departments depending on what drives overhead costs for each department. For example, the Hull Fabrication department at SailRite Company may find that overhead costs are driven more by the use of machinery than by labor, and therefore decides to use machine hours as the allocation base. The Assembly department may find that overhead costs are driven more by labor activity than by machine use and therefore decides to use labor hours or labor costs as the allocation base.</p>

The cost pool in the Hull Fabrication department is estimated to be $3,000,000 for the year, and the cost pool in the Assembly department is estimated at $5,000,000. Note that total estimated overhead cost is still $8,000,000 (= $3,000,000 + $5,000,000). Machine hours (estimated at 60,000 hours) will be used as the allocation base for Hull Fabrication, and direct labor hours (estimated at 217,000 hours) will be used as the allocation base for Assembly.

        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch03_s02_s02_p05">The department allocation approach allows cost pools to be formed for each department and provides for flexibility in the selection of an allocation base. Although <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch03_s02_s02_f01">Figure 3.3 "Using Department Rates to Allocate SailRite Company’s Overhead"</a> shows just two rates, many companies have more than two departments and therefore more than two rates. Organizations that use this approach tend to have simple operations within each department but different activities across departments. One department may use machinery, while another department may use labor, as is the case with SailRite’s two departments. This approach typically provides more accurate cost information than simply using one plantwide rate but still relies on the assumption that overhead costs are driven by direct labor hours, direct labor costs, or machine hours. This assumption of a causal relationship is increasingly less realistic as production processes become more complex.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch03_s02_s02_p06">The plantwide and department allocation methods are “traditional” approaches because both typically use direct labor hours, direct labor costs, or machine hours as the allocation base, and both were used prior to the creation of activity-based costing in the 1980s.</p>

The idea is that activities are required to produce products—activities such as purchasing materials, setting up machinery, assembling products, and inspecting finished products. These activities can be costly. Thus the cost of activities should be allocated to products based on the products’ use of the activities.</p>

As you work through the example for SailRite Company, once again note that total estimated overhead costs remain at $8,000,000.

Companies that use activity-based costing, such as <strong class="emphasis bold">Hewlett Packard</strong> and <strong class="emphasis bold">IBM</strong>, may identify hundreds of activities required to make their products. The most challenging part of this step is narrowing down the activities to those that have the biggest impact on overhead costs.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch03_s03_s01_p04">After meeting with personnel throughout the company, SailRite’s accountant identified the following activities as having the biggest impact on overhead costs:</p>

Using activity-based costing, we identified five key activities and assigned overhead costs based on the use of these activities. The Deluxe process consumed more than 20 percent of the resources provided for every activity.

            <h2 class="title editable block">Advantages</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch03_s03_s02_s01_p01"><strong class="emphasis bold">More accurate cost information leads to better decisions.</strong> The cost information provided by ABC is generally regarded as more accurate than the information provided by most traditional costing methods. This allows management to make better decisions in areas such as product pricing, product line changes (adding products or eliminating products), and product mix decisions (how much of each product to produce and sell).</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch03_s03_s02_s01_p02"><strong class="emphasis bold">Increased knowledge of production activities leads to process improvements and reduced costs.</strong> ABC requires identifying the activities involved in the production process (step 1) and assigning costs to these activities (step 2). This provides management with a better view of the detailed activities involved (purchasing materials, machine setups, inspections, and so forth) and the cost of each activity. Managers are more likely to focus on improving efficiency in the most costly activities, thereby reducing costs.</p>

        <div class="section" id="heisinger_1.0-ch03_s03_s02_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Disadvantages</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch03_s03_s02_s02_p01"><strong class="emphasis bold">ABC systems can be costly to implement.</strong> ABC systems require teamwork across the organization and therefore require employees to take time out from their day-to-day activities to assist in the ABC process (e.g., to identify costly activities). Assigning costs to activities takes time, as does identifying and tracking cost drivers. And assigning costs to products requires a significant amount of time in the accounting department. Imagine having 15 cost pools (activities), each with a predetermined overhead rate used to assign overhead costs to the company’s 80 products—not an unrealistic example for a large company. The accounting costs incurred to maintain such a system can be prohibitively high.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch03_s03_s02_s02_p02"><strong class="emphasis bold">Unitizing fixed costs can be misleading.</strong> Product costing involves allocating costs from activity centers to products and calculating a product cost per unit. The problem with this approach is that fixed costs are often a large part of the overhead costs being allocated (e.g., building and machinery depreciation and supervisor salaries). Recall that fixed costs are costs that <em class="emphasis">do not change in total</em> with changes in activity.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch03_s03_s02_s02_p03">Looking back to the SailRite example using activity-based costing, the Deluxe sailboat cost $5,030 per unit to produce based on production of 1,000 units (as shown in <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch03_s03_s01_f02">Figure 3.5 "Allocation of Overhead Costs to Products at SailRite Company"</a>). If SailRite produces 2,000 units of the Deluxe boat, will the unit cost remain at $5,030? Probably not. A significant portion of overhead costs are fixed and will be spread out over more units, thereby reducing the cost per unit. We address this issue at length in later chapters. The point here is that managers must beware of using per unit cost information blindly for decision making, particularly if a significant change in the level of production is anticipated.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch03_s03_s02_s02_p04"><strong class="emphasis bold">The benefits may not outweigh the costs.</strong> Companies with one or two products that require very little variation in production may not benefit from an ABC system. Suppose a company produces one product. The overhead costs can be divided into as many cost pools as you like, but all overhead costs will still be assigned to the one product. (We should mention, however, that management would benefit from understanding the activities involved in the process and the costs associated with each activity. It’s the allocation to the one product—steps 4 and 5 of ABC—that would provide little useful information in this scenario.)</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch03_s03_s02_s02_p05">Companies that produce several different products may believe that the benefits of implementing ABC will outweigh the costs. However, management must be willing to use the ABC information to benefit the company. Companies like <strong class="emphasis bold">Chrysler Group LLC</strong> have been known to try ABC, only to meet resistance from their managers. Until managers are willing to use the ABC information to make improvements in the organization, there is no point in implementing such a system.</p>

The cost flows are the same for an activity-based costing system, with one exception. Instead of using one plantwide overhead rate to allocate (or apply) overhead to products, an ABC system uses several overhead rates to allocate overhead. The entry to record this allocation—whether it involves one rate or multiple rates—is the same as the entry in <a class="xref" href="heisinger_1.0-ch02#heisinger_1.0-ch02">Chapter 2 "How Is Job Costing Used to Track Production Costs?"</a>. Simply debit work-in-process inventory and credit manufacturing overhead for the amount of overhead applied. (Some companies use separate work-in-process inventory and manufacturing overhead accounts for each activity. For the sake of simplicity, we do not use separate accounts.)</p>

                <li>Activity-based costing focuses on identifying the activities required to make products, on forming cost pools for each activity, and on allocating overhead costs to the products based on their use of each activity. ABC systems and traditional systems often result in vastly different product costs. But even if the resulting product costs are not much different, ABC provides managers with a better understanding of the production activities required for each activity and the associated costs, which often leads to improved efficiency and reduced costs.</li>

            <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch03_s03_s04_p03"><strong class="emphasis bold">BuyGasCo Corporation</strong>, a privately owned chain of gas stations based in Florida, was taken to court for selling regular grade gasoline below cost, and an injunction was issued. Florida law prohibits selling gasoline below refinery cost if doing so injures competition. Using a plantwide approach of allocating costs to products, the plaintiff’s costing expert was able to support the allegation of predatory pricing. The defendant’s expert witness, an accounting professor, used activity-based costing to dispute the allegation.</p>
            <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch03_s03_s04_p04">Both costing experts had to allocate costs to each of the three grades of gasoline (regular, plus, and premium) to determine a total cost per grade of fuel and a cost per gallon for each grade. Sales of regular grade fuel were significantly higher (63 percent of total sales) than the other two grades. Using the plantwide approach, the plaintiff‘s expert allocated all costs based on gallons of gas sold. Using the activity-based costing approach, the defendant‘s expert formed three activity cost pools—labor, kiosk, and gas dispensing. The first two cost pools allocated costs using gallons of gas sold and therefore were allocated as they would be with the plantwide approach (63 percent for regular grade, 20 percent for plus, and 17 percent for premium). The third cost pool (gas dispensing) allocated costs equally to each grade of fuel (i.e., one-third of costs to each grade of fuel). The gas dispensing pool included costs for storage tanks, all of which were the same size, as well as gas pumps and signs.</p>
            <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch03_s03_s04_p05">Compared with the plantwide approach, activity-based costing showed a lower cost per gallon for regular gas and a higher cost per gallon for the other two grades of fuel. Once the ABC information was presented, the case was settled, and the initial injunction was lifted.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch03_s04_p04">This involves interviewing personnel throughout the company. Recall that activity-based costing also requires the identification of key activities. However, ABM allows for a more detailed analysis because the estimation of costs and related overhead rates are not required when using ABM.</p>
    <p class="para block"> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch03_s04_p05"><strong class="emphasis bold">Step 2. Determine whether activities are value-added or non-value-added.</strong></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch03_s04_p06">Activities that add to the product’s quality and performance are called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">value-added activities</a><span class="glossdef">Activities that add to a product’s quality and performance.</span></span>. Activities that do not add to the product’s quality and performance are called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">non-value-added activities</a><span class="glossdef">Activities that do not add to a product’s quality and performance.</span></span>. Examples of value-added activities at SailRite include using materials and machines to produce hulls and assembling each sailboat. Examples of non-value-added activities include storing parts in a warehouse and letting machinery sit idle.</p>
    <p class="para block"> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch03_s04_p07"><strong class="emphasis bold">Step 3. Continuously improve the value-added activities and minimize or eliminate the non-value-added activities.</strong></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch03_s04_p08">Even if an activity is identified as value-added, ABM requires the continuous improvement of the activity. For example, SailRite’s assembly process (a value-added activity) may require workers to shift back and forth between Basic and Deluxe sailboats throughout the day, each of which uses different parts and requires different tools. Perhaps the efficiency of this process could be improved by assembling the boats in batches—one day working on Basic boats, another day working on Deluxe boats.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch03_s04_p09">Activities that are non-value-added should be minimized or eliminated. For example, storing parts in a warehouse at SailRite (a non-value-added activity) might be minimized by moving to a just-in-time system that requires suppliers to deliver parts immediately before they are needed for production.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch03_s04_p10">The next time you visit a fast-food restaurant, go to a clothing store, or stand in line at a college bookstore, try to identify value-added and non-value-added activities. Think about ways the organization can eliminate non-value-added activities and improve value-added activities.</p>

                    <p class="para">Activity-based costing results in a significant increase of overhead costs allocated to the tax product and a decrease of overhead costs allocated to the audit product. The plantwide allocation approach allocates overhead based on direct labor hours, which results in 25 percent of all overhead costs being allocated to tax (= 10,000 direct labor hours in tax ÷ 40,000 total direct labor hours) and 75 percent to audit. However, ABC shows that tax uses 60 percent of scheduling and data entry resources (= 150 tax clients ÷ 250 total clients), 90 percent of advertising resources (= 45 tax ads ÷ 50 total ads), and 50 percent of computer resources (= 2,500 tax computer hours ÷ 5,000 total computer hours). Thus tax is allocated more overhead costs using ABC than using one plantwide rate based on direct labor hours. Note that total profit of $370,000 is the same regardless of the overhead cost allocation approach used. Using the plantwide allocation approach, $370,000 = $120,000 + $250,000. Using the ABC approach, $370,000 = ($210,000) + $580,000.</p>
                    <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch03_s05_s02_p11">Management must use this information to make improvements to the company’s operations. It would probably be unwise to eliminate tax services because of the connection they have with audit services (i.e., audit clients may appreciate the convenience of also having tax services available to them). However, management can look for ways to make the process more efficient by focusing on costly activities identified in the ABC analysis.</p>
                    <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch03_s05_s02_p12">Note that when calculating product costs for service organizations, it is difficult, if not impossible, to calculate a product cost <em class="emphasis">per unit</em>. Most service organizations do not have an easily defined unit of measure because services vary so much from one customer to another. One alternative is to calculate total profit as a percent of total sales revenue. This allows for a comparison of profitability between different types of services, similar to comparing the profitability for units of product.</p>

The choice of an allocation method is not critical to this process. Companies that use direct labor hours, machine hours, activity-based costing, or some other method to allocate overhead costs to products are likely to be in compliance with U.S. GAAP. Throughout this chapter, we have illustrated how ABC is used to allocate manufacturing overhead costs. However, organizations often use ABC for purposes that go beyond allocating costs solely for external reporting. </em><em class="emphasis bolditalic">How might ABC be used to help companies in areas other than external reporting?</em></p>
        <p class="para block"> </p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch03_s06_s01_p02">Answer: Commissions paid to sales people for the sale of specific products (often called <em class="emphasis">selling, general, and administrative</em>) are included as an operating expense in financial reports prepared for external users as required by U.S. GAAP. However, many organizations may assign commission costs to specific products for internal decision-making purposes. This treatment is not in compliance with U.S. GAAP, but it is perfectly acceptable for internal reporting purposes and may be done using activity-based costing. It is important to understand that managers have ultimate control over which costs should be allocated to products for internal reporting purposes, and this allocation often involves going beyond overhead costs.</p>

The allocation rate for computer support services is $2,000 per computer (= $150,000 ÷ 75 computers). Thus the Hull Fabrication department receives an allocation of $26,250 in human resource costs (= 35 employees × $750 rate) and $84,000 in computer support costs (= 42 computers × $2,000 rate). The Assembly department receives an allocation of $63,750 in human resource costs (= 85 employees × $750 rate) and $66,000 in computer support costs (= 33 computers × $2,000 rate).</p>

If management chooses to allocate service department costs to production departments as described here, there must be some benefit to going through the process. Should these costs be assigned to activity cost pools for the purpose of costing products (activity-based costing)? Should production department managers be evaluated based on the use of these services? Should actual service department usage be compared to budgeted usage for each production department? The answers to these questions vary from one organization to the next. However, one point is certain—the benefits of implementing this allocation system must outweigh the costs!</p>

A number of methods can be used to assist in the cost allocation process. For example, the cost of service departments can be allocated to production departments using the direct method. Also the cost hierarchy can be used to help establish cost pools and identify cost drivers used to allocate costs.

If you tell your employees to stop using the cafeteria, more costs will be allocated to other departments, and the other departments might also stop using the cafeteria. My belief is that the cafeteria will be self-sufficient within a year if more employees are encouraged to use it. This translates into no more cost allocations to departments within a year.
