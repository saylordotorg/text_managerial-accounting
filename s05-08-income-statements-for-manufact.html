The accounting process and income statement for service companies are relatively simple. Merchandising companies (also called retail companies) like </em><em class="emphasis bolditalic">Macy’s </em><em class="emphasis">and </em><em class="emphasis bolditalic">Home Depot </em><em class="emphasis">buy and sell goods but typically do not manufacture goods. Since merchandising companies must account for the purchase and sale of goods, their accounting systems are more complex than those of service companies. Manufacturing companies, such as </em><em class="emphasis bolditalic">Johnson &amp; Johnson </em><em class="emphasis">and </em><em class="emphasis bolditalic">Honda Motor Company</em><em class="emphasis">, produce and sell goods. Such companies require an accounting system that goes well beyond accounting solely for the purchase and sale of goods. </em><em class="emphasis bolditalic">Why are accounting systems more complex for manufacturing companies?</em></p>
    <p class="para block"> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s08_p02">Answer: Accounting systems are more complex for manufacturing companies because they need a system that tracks manufacturing costs throughout the production process to the point at which goods are sold. Since income statements for manufacturing companies tend to be more complex than for service or merchandising companies, we devote this section to income statements for manufacturing companies. Understanding income statements in a manufacturing setting begins with the inventory cost flow equation.</p>

        <p class="para block"> </p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s08_s01_p02">Answer: We can use the basic cost flow equation to calculate unknown balances for just about any balance sheet account (e.g., cash, accounts receivable, and inventory). The equation is as follows:</p>
        <div class="callout block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s08_s01_n01">

        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s08_s01_p03">We will apply this equation to the three inventory asset accounts discussed earlier (raw materials, work in process, and finished goods) to calculate the cost of raw materials used in production, cost of goods manufactured, and cost of goods sold.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s08_s01_p04"><em class="emphasis">Raw materials used in production</em> shows the cost of direct and indirect materials placed into the production process. <em class="emphasis">Cost of goods manufactured</em> represents the cost of goods completed and transferred out of work-in-process (WIP) inventory into finished goods inventory. <em class="emphasis">Cost of goods sold</em> represents the cost of goods that are sold and transferred out of finished goods inventory into cost of goods sold.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s08_s01_p05">Accountants need all these amounts—raw materials placed in production, cost of goods manufactured, and cost of goods sold—to prepare an income statement for a manufacturing company.

As you review these schedules, note that each schedule provides information required for the next schedule, as indicated by the arrows. Remember the inventory cost flow equation is used for each schedule. This is why you see abbreviations for each element of the equation: beginning balance <em class="emphasis">(BB)</em>, transfers in <em class="emphasis">(TI)</em>, ending balance <em class="emphasis">(EB)</em>, and transfers out <em class="emphasis">(TO)</em>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s08_s01_p08">The goal of going through the process shown in <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch01_s08_s01_f01">Figure 1.7 "Income Statement Schedules for Custom Furniture Company"</a> is to arrive at a cost of goods sold amount, which is presented on the income statement. Custom Furniture Company’s income statement for the month ended May 31 is shown in <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch01_s08_s01_f02">Figure 1.8 "Income Statement for Custom Furniture Company"</a>. As you review <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch01_s08_s01_f01">Figure 1.7 "Income Statement Schedules for Custom Furniture Company"</a> and <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch01_s08_s01_f02">Figure 1.8 "Income Statement for Custom Furniture Company"</a>, look back at <a class="xref" href="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s07#heisinger_1.0-ch01_s07_s02_f01">Figure 1.6 "Flow of Product Costs through Balance Sheet and Income Statement Accounts"</a> to see how costs flow through the three inventory accounts and the cost of goods sold account.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s08_s01_p09">In <a class="xref" href="heisinger_1.0-ch02#heisinger_1.0-ch02">Chapter 2 "How Is Job Costing Used to Track Production Costs?"</a>, we provide the detailed information necessary to prepare the schedules and income statement presented in <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch01_s08_s01_f01">Figure 1.7 "Income Statement Schedules for Custom Furniture Company"</a> and <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch01_s08_s01_f02">Figure 1.8 "Income Statement for Custom Furniture Company"</a>. At this point, your job is to understand how we use the inventory cost flow equation to calculate raw materials placed in production, cost of goods manufactured, and cost of goods sold. (Note: Companies using a perpetual inventory system do not necessarily prepare these formal schedules because perpetual systems update records immediately when inventory is transferred from one inventory account to another. However, these companies take a physical count periodically to ensure the accuracy of inventory accounts and use the cost flow equation and similar schedules to ensure their perpetual system balances are accurate. <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch01_s08_s01_n02">Note 1.62 "Business in Action 1.8"</a> shows how the cost flow equation can be used to analyze the effects of fraud that was allegedly committed at Rite Aid.)</p>

In 2002, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed accounting fraud charges against several former executives of <strong class="emphasis bold">Rite Aid</strong>. The SEC complaint alleged that <strong class="emphasis bold">Rite Aid</strong> had significantly overstated income for several years.</p>
            <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s08_s01_p11">According to the complaint, <strong class="emphasis bold">Rite Aid</strong> executives committed financial fraud in several areas, one of which involved inventory. At the end of the company’s fiscal year, the physical inventory count showed $9,000,000 less than <strong class="emphasis bold">Rite Aid’s</strong> inventory balance on the books, presumably due to physical deterioration of the goods or theft. <strong class="emphasis bold">Rite Aid</strong> executives allegedly failed to record this shrinkage, thereby overstating ending inventory on the balance sheet and understating cost of goods sold on the income statement.</p>
            <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s08_s01_p12">Using the cost flow equation, you can see how failing to record the $9,000,000 loss would understate cost of goods sold.</p>

This ultimately increased profit by $9,000,000 because reported expenses were too low.</p>
            <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s08_s01_p14">This inventory fraud was a relatively small part of the fraud allegedly committed by <strong class="emphasis bold">Rite Aid</strong> executives.

The former chief executive, Martin Grass, was sentenced to eight years in prison and the former chief financial officer, Franklyn Bergonzi, was sentenced to 28 months in prison. <strong class="emphasis bold">Rite Aid’s</strong> stock fell from a high of $50 per share to $5 per share in 2003.</p>

            <li>Merchandising companies do not calculate the raw materials placed in production or cost of goods manufactured (shown in the top section of <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch01_s08_s01_f01">Figure 1.7 "Income Statement Schedules for Custom Furniture Company"</a>).</li>
