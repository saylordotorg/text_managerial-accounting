This type of decision differs from the decisions covered in the previous chapter because long-term investment decisions affect organizations for several years. We will return to Julie’s plan to purchase a new copier after we provide background information on long-term investment decisions.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch08_s01_p02">Answer: The types of decisions covered in this chapter and <a class="xref" href="heisinger_1.0-ch07#heisinger_1.0-ch07">Chapter 7 "How Are Relevant Revenues and Costs Used to Make Decisions?"</a> are similar in that they require an analysis of differential revenues and costs. However, <a class="xref" href="heisinger_1.0-ch07#heisinger_1.0-ch07">Chapter 7 "How Are Relevant Revenues and Costs Used to Make Decisions?"</a> involves short-run operating decisions (e.g., special orders from customers), while this chapter focuses on long-run capacity decisions (e.g., purchasing long-lived assets to increase capacity for many years).</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch08_s01_p03">Organizations make a variety of long-run investment decisions. The <strong class="emphasis bold">San Francisco Symphony</strong> invests in stage risers for its orchestra members. <strong class="emphasis bold">McDonald’s</strong> invests in new restaurants. <strong class="emphasis bold">Honda Motor Co.</strong> invests in new manufacturing facilities. <strong class="emphasis bold">Bank of America</strong> invests in new branches.

    <p class="para block"> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch08_s01_p05">Answer: When looking at capital budgeting decisions that affect future years, we must consider the time value of money. The time value of money concept is the premise that a dollar received today is worth more than a dollar received in the future. To clarify this point, suppose a friend owes you $100. Would you prefer to receive $100 today or 3 years from today? The money is worth more to you if you receive it today because you can invest the $100 for 3 years.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch08_s01_p06">For capital budgeting decisions, the issue is how to value future cash flows in today’s dollars. The term <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">cash flow</a><span class="glossdef">The amount of cash received or paid at a specific point in time.</span></span> refers to the amount of cash received or paid at a specific point in time.

        <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch08_s01_p08">The decision to open new stores is an example of a capital budgeting decision because management must analyze the cash flows associated with the new stores over the long term.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch08_s01_p09">When managers evaluate investments in long-term assets, they want to know how much cash would be spent on the investment and how much cash would be received as a result of the investment. The investment proposal is likely rejected if cash inflows do not exceed cash outflows. (Think about a personal investment. If you would receive only $700 in the future from an investment of $1,000 today, you undoubtedly would not make the investment because you would lose $300!) If cash inflows are expected to exceed cash outflows, managers must consider <em class="emphasis">when</em> the cash inflows and outflows occur before taking on the investment. (Again, consider an investment of $1,000 today. If you expect to receive $1,050 in 20 years rather than at the end of 1 year, you would probably think twice before investing because it would take 20 years to make $50!)</p>

Assume $1 will be received 4 years from today (<em class="emphasis">n</em> = 4), and the interest rate is 10 percent (<em class="emphasis">r</em> = 10 percent). What is the present value of this cash flow? Look at <a class="xref" href="heisinger_1.0-ch08_s08#heisinger_1.0-ch08_s08_f01">Figure 8.9 "Present Value of $1 Received at the End of "</a> in the appendix. Find the column labeled <em class="emphasis">10 percent</em> and the row labeled <em class="emphasis">4</em>. The present value is $0.6830, or $0.68 rounded. The table amount given is often called a <em class="emphasis">factor</em>. The factor in this example is 0.6830 (note that the formula to find this factor is shown at the top of <a class="xref" href="heisinger_1.0-ch08_s08#heisinger_1.0-ch08_s08_f01">Figure 8.9 "Present Value of $1 Received at the End of "</a>).</p>

    <p class="para block"> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch08_s02_p15">Answer: Although managers often estimate the interest rate, this estimate is typically based on the organization’s <em class="emphasis">cost of capital</em>. The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">cost of capital</a><span class="glossdef">The weighted average costs associated with debt and equity used to fund long-term investments.</span></span> is the weighted average costs associated with debt and equity used to fund long-term investments. The cost of debt is simply the interest rate associated with the debt (e.g., interest for bank loans or bonds issued). The cost of equity is more difficult to determine and represents the return required by owners of the organization. The weighted average of these two sources of capital represents the cost of capital (finance textbooks address the complexities of this calculation in more detail).</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch08_s02_p16">The general rule is the higher the risk of the investment, the higher the required rate of return (assume <em class="emphasis">required rate of return</em> is synonymous with <em class="emphasis">interest rate</em> for the purpose of calculating the NPV). A firm evaluating a long-term investment with risk similar to the firm’s average risk will typically use the cost of capital. However, if a long-term investment carries higher than average risk for the firm, the firm will use a required rate of return higher than the cost of capital.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch08_s02_p17">The accountant at Jackson’s Quality Copies, Mike Haley, has established the cost of capital for the firm at 10 percent. Since the proposed purchase of a copy machine is of average risk to the company, Mike will use 10 percent as the required rate of return.</p>

    <p class="para block"> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch08_s03_p02">Answer: The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">internal rate of return (IRR)</a><span class="glossdef">A method used to evaluate long-term investments. It is defined as the rate required to get a net present value of zero for a series of cash flows.</span></span> is the rate required (<em class="emphasis">r</em>) to get an NPV of zero for a series of cash flows. The IRR represents the time-adjusted rate of return for the investment being considered. The <em class="emphasis">IRR decision rule</em> states that if the IRR is greater than or equal to the company’s required rate of return (recall that this is often called the <em class="emphasis">hurdle rate</em>), the investment is accepted; otherwise, the investment is rejected.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch08_s03_p03">Most managers use a spreadsheet, such as Excel, to calculate the IRR for an investment (we discuss this later in the chapter). However, we can also use trial and error to approximate the IRR. <em class="emphasis">The goal is simply to find the rate that generates an NPV of zero.</em> Let’s go back to the Jackson’s Quality Copies example. <a class="xref" href="heisinger_1.0-ch08_s02#heisinger_1.0-ch08_s02_s02_f01">Figure 8.4 "Alternative NPV Calculation for Jackson’s Quality Copies"</a> provides the projected cash flows for a new copy machine and the NPV calculation using a rate of 10 percent. Recall that the NPV was $1,250, indicating the investment generates a return greater than the company’s required rate of return of 10 percent.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch08_s03_p04">Although it is useful to know that the investment’s return is greater than the company’s required rate of return, managers often want to know the exact return generated by the investment. (It is often not enough to state that the exact return is something higher than 10 percent!) Managers also like to rank investment opportunities by the return each investment is expected to generate. Our goal now is to determine the exact return—that is, to determine the IRR.

As shown in the middle of <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch08_s03_f01">Figure 8.5 "Finding the IRR for Jackson’s Quality Copies"</a>, 11 percent provides an NPV of $(469).

Knowing that 15 percent results in an NPV of $(14,720), and therefore seeing the return is less than 15 percent, we decreased the rate to 13 percent. As shown in the following figure, this resulted in an NPV of $15,720, which indicates the return is higher than 13 percent. Using a rate of 14 percent results in an NPV very close to 0 at $224.

        <p class="para block"> </p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch08_s04_s01_p02">Answer: Both methods of evaluating long-term investments, NPV and IRR, focus on the amount of cash flows and when the cash flows occur. Note that the timing of revenues and costs in financial accounting using the accrual basis is often not the same as when the cash inflows and outflows occur. A sale can be recorded in one period, and the cash be collected in a future period. Costs can occur in one period, and the cash be paid in a future period. For the purpose of making NPV and IRR calculations, managers typically use the time period when the cash flow occurs.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch08_s04_s01_p03">When a company invests in a long-term asset, such as a production building, the cash outflow for the asset is included in the NPV and IRR analyses. The depreciation taken on the asset in future periods is not a cash flow and is <em class="emphasis">not</em> included in the NPV and IRR calculations. However, there is a cash benefit related to depreciation (often called a <em class="emphasis">depreciation tax shield</em>) since income taxes paid are reduced as a result of recording depreciation expense. We explore the impact of income taxes on NPV and IRR calculations later in the chapter.</p>

        <p class="para block"> </p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch08_s04_s02_p02">Answer: Most managers make cash flow projections that include an adjustment for inflation. When this is done, a rate must be used that also factors in inflation over the life of the investment. As discussed earlier in the chapter, the required rate of return used for NPV calculations is based on the firm’s cost of capital, which is the weighted average cost of debt and equity. Since the cost of debt and equity already includes the effect of inflation, no inflation adjustment is necessary when establishing the required rate of return.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch08_s04_s02_p03">The important point here is that <em class="emphasis">cash flow projections must include adjustments for inflation to match the required rate of return, which already factors in inflation.</em> If cash flows are not adjusted for inflation, managers are likely underestimating future cash flows and therefore underestimating the NPV of the investment opportunity. This is particularly pronounced for economies that have relatively high rates of inflation.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch08_s04_s02_p04">For the purposes of this chapter, assume all cash flows and required rates of return are adjusted for inflation.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Be Aware of Qualitative Factors</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch08_s04_s03_p01"><em class="emphasis">Question: So far, this chapter has focused on using cash flow projections and the time value of money to evaluate long-term investments. Using these quantitative factors to make decisions allows managers to support decisions with measurable data. For example, the investment opportunity at Jackson’s Quality Copies presented at the beginning of the chapter was accepted because the NPV of $1,250 was greater than 0, and the IRR of 11 percent was greater than the company’s required rate of return of 10 percent. </em><em class="emphasis bolditalic">Why do most companies also consider nonfinancial factors, often called qualitative factors, when making a long-term investment decision?</em></p>
        <p class="para block"> </p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch08_s04_s03_p02">Answer: Although using quantitative factors for decision making is important, qualitative factors may outweigh the quantitative factors in making a decision. For example, a large manufacturer of medical devices recently invested several million dollars in a small start-up medical device firm. When asked about the NPV analysis, the manager responsible for the investment indicated, “My staff did a quick and dirty NPV analysis, which indicated we should not invest in the company. However, the technology they were using for their device was of such strategic importance to us, we could not pass up the investment.” This is an example of <em class="emphasis">qualitative</em> factors (strategic importance to the company) outweighing <em class="emphasis">quantitative</em> factors (negative NPV).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch08_s04_s03_p03">Similar situations often arise when companies must invest in long-term assets even though NPV and IRR analyses indicate otherwise. Here are a few examples:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch08_s04_s03_l01">
            <li>Investing in new production facilities may be essential to maintaining a reputation as the industry leader in innovation, even though the quantitative analysis (NPV and IRR) points to rejecting the investment. (It is difficult to quantify the benefits of being the “industry leader in innovation.”)</li>
            <li>Investing in pollution control devices for an oil refinery may provide social benefits even though the quantitative analysis (NPV and IRR) points to rejecting the investment. (Although a reduction in fines and legal costs may be quantifiable and included in the analyses, it is difficult to quantify the social benefits.)</li>
            <li>Investing in a new product line of entry-level automobiles may increase foot traffic at the showroom, resulting in increased sales of other products, even though the quantitative analysis (NPV and IRR) points to rejecting the investment. (It is difficult to quantify the impact of the new product line on sales of existing product lines.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch08_s04_s03_p04">Clearly, managers must look at the financial information and analysis when considering whether to invest in long-term assets. However, the analysis does not stop with financial information. Managers and decision makers must also consider qualitative factors.</p>

        <p class="para block"> </p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch08_s04_s04_p02">Answer: Several examples are provided next.</p>
        <div class="section" id="heisinger_1.0-ch08_s04_s04_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Short-Term Incentives Affect Long-Term Decisions</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch08_s04_s04_s01_p01">Managers are often evaluated and compensated based on annual financial results. The financial results are typically measured using financial accounting data prepared on an accrual basis.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch08_s04_s04_s01_p02">Suppose you are a manager considering an investment opportunity to start a new product line that has a positive NPV. Because the NPV is positive, you should accept the investment proposal. However, revenues and related cash inflows are not significant until after the second year. In the first two years, revenues are low and depreciation charges are high, resulting in significantly lower overall company net income than if the project were rejected. Assuming you are evaluated and compensated based on annual net income, you may be inclined to reject the new product line regardless of the NPV analysis.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch08_s04_s04_s01_p03">Many companies are aware of this conflict between the manager’s incentive to improve short-term results and the company’s goal to improve long-term results. To mitigate this conflict, some companies offer managers part ownership in the company (e.g., through stock options), creating an incentive to increase the value of the company over the long run.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Modifying Cash Flow Estimates to Get Approval</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch08_s04_s04_s02_p01">Managers often have a vested interest in getting proposals approved regardless of NPV and IRR results. For example, assume a manager spent several years developing a plan to construct a new production facility. Because of the significant work involved, and the projected benefits of building a new facility, the manager wants to see the proposal approved. However, the NPV analysis indicates the production facility proposal does not meet the company’s minimum required rate of return. As a result, the manager decides to inflate projected cash inflows to get a positive NPV, and the project is approved.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch08_s04_s04_s02_p02">Clearly, a conflict exists between the company’s desire to accept projects that meet or exceed the required rate of return and the manager’s desire to get approval for a “pet” project regardless of its profitability. Again, having part ownership in a company provides an incentive for managers to reject proposals that will not increase the value of the company.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch08_s04_s04_s02_p03">Another way to mitigate this conflict is to conduct a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">postaudit</a><span class="glossdef">Compares the original capital budget with the actual results.</span></span>, which compares the original capital budget with the actual results. Managers who provide misleading capital budget analyses are identified through this process. Postaudits provide an incentive for managers to provide accurate estimates.</p>

                    <li>Projected cash flows must include an adjustment for inflation to match the required rate of return. The required rate of return is based on the company’s weighted average cost of debt and equity. The cost of debt and equity already factors in inflation. Thus the cash flows must also factor in inflation to be consistent with the required rate of return.</li>
                    <li>Although managers prefer to make capital budgeting decisions based on quantifiable data (e.g., using NPV or IRR), nonfinancial factors may outweigh financial factors. For example, maintaining a reputation as the industry leader may require investing in long-term assets, even though the investment does not meet the minimum required rate of return. The management believes the qualitative factor of being the industry leader is critical to the company’s future success and decides to make the investment.</li>

                            <li>The manager’s bonus is based on achieving a certain level of net income each year, and the new store will likely cause net income to decrease in the first two years. Thus the manager may not be able to achieve the net income necessary to qualify for the bonus if the company invests in the new store.</li>
                            <li>To mitigate this conflict, Best Electronics can offer the manager part ownership in the company (perhaps through stock options).

    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch08_s05_p03">Managers who are concerned about cash flow want to know how long it will take to recover the initial investment. The payback method provides this information. Managers may also require a payback period equal to or less than some specified time period. For example, Julie Jackson, the owner of Jackson’s Quality Copies, may require a payback period of no more than five years, regardless of the NPV or IRR.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch08_s05_p04">Note that the payback method has two significant weaknesses. First, it does <em class="emphasis">not</em> consider the time value of money. Second, it only considers the cash inflows until the investment cash outflows are recovered; cash inflows after the payback period are not part of the analysis. Both of these weaknesses require that managers use care when applying the payback method.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch08_s05_s01_p03">The payback method answers the question “how long will it take to recover my initial $50,000 investment?” With annual cash inflows of $10,000 starting in year 1, the payback period for this investment is 5 years (= $50,000 initial investment ÷ $10,000 annual cash receipts). This calculation is relatively simple when one investment is made at the beginning, and annual cash inflows are identical. However, some investments require cash outflows at different points throughout the life of the asset, and cash inflows can vary from one year to the next. <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch08_s05_s01_t01">Table 8.1 "Calculating the Payback Period for Jackson’s Quality Copies"</a> provides a format to help calculate the payback period for these more complex investments.

If the company requires a payback period of two years or less, the first investment is preferable. However, the first investment generates only $3,000 in cash after its payback period while the second investment generates $35,000 after its payback period. The payback method ignores both of these amounts even though the second investment generates significant cash inflows after year 3. Again, it would be preferable to calculate the IRR to compare these two investments. The IRR for the first investment is 4 percent, and the IRR for the second investment is 18 percent.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch08_s05_s02_p07">Although the payback method is useful in certain situations where companies are concerned about recovering investments as quickly as possible (e.g., companies on the verge of bankruptcy), it is <em class="emphasis">not</em> a measure of profitability. The NPV and IRR methods compare the profitability of each investment by considering the time value of money for all cash flows related to the investment.</p>

                <li>The payback method evaluates how long it will take to “pay back” or recover the initial investment. The payback period, typically stated in years, is the time it takes to generate enough cash receipts from an investment to cover the cash outflow(s) for the investment. Although this method is useful for managers concerned about cash flow, the major weaknesses of this method are that it ignores the time value of money, and it ignores cash flows after the payback period.</li>

With these assumptions, we simply need to calculate how many months are required in year 4 to recover the remaining $40,000. $40,000 divided by $220,000 equals 0.18 (rounded). Thus 0.18 of a year, or approximately 2 months (= 0.18 × 12 months), is required to recover the remaining $40,000. This more precise calculation results in a payback period of three years and two months. Note that the salvage value is ignored as this cash inflow occurs at the end of year 4 when the machine is sold.</p>

                <li>First, the payback method does <em class="emphasis">not</em> consider the time value of money (no present value or IRR calculations are performed). Second, it only considers the cash inflows until the investment cash outflows are recovered; cash inflows after the payback period are not part of the analysis. For Chip Manufacturing, Inc., the payback period is three years and two months. However, significant cash inflows totaling $280,000 occur after the payback period and therefore are ignored ($280,000 = $320,000 year 4 cash inflows – $40,000 remaining investment recovered in the first 2 months of year 4).</li>

Many long-term investments require working capital. For example, <strong class="emphasis bold">JCPenney</strong> will need cash in its registers when it opens the new store.

Simply calculate how many months are required in year 5 to recover the remaining $90,000. $90,000 divided by $160,000 equals 0.56 (rounded). Thus 0.56 of a year, or approximately 7 months (= 0.56 × 12 months), is required to recover the remaining $90,000.

The initial investment required to purchase production equipment is $400,000 (to be depreciated over 5 years using the straight-line method, with no salvage value). An additional $50,000 in working capital is required for the contract. Working capital will be returned to SPI at the end of five years.

        <ul class="itemizedlist" id="heisinger_1.0-ch08_s07_l07">
            <li>Companies that pay income taxes must consider the impact income taxes have on cash flows for long-term investments, and make the necessary adjustments. Investment and working capital cash flows are not adjusted because these cash flows do not affect taxable income. Revenue cash inflows and expense cash outflows are adjusted by multiplying the cash flow by (1 – tax rate). Although depreciation expense is not a cash outflow, it provides tax savings. The tax savings is calculated by multiplying depreciation expense by the tax rate. Once these adjustments are made, we can calculate the NPV and IRR.</li>

The company would like to expand its operations and is considering a move to one of two locations. The first location, Wyatville, is one hour from the ocean and therefore attractive for employees who like to travel on weekends. The second location, Kenton, is not as close to the ocean, and much further from desirable vacation destinations.</p>
                <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch08_s08_p25">The company’s controller, Lisa Lennox, created a net present value analysis for each location. The Kenton location had a positive net present value, and the Wyatville location had a negative net present value. Upon providing this information to the chief financial officer of the company, Max Madden, Lisa was asked to “review the numbers carefully and make sure all the benefits of moving to Wyatville were included in the analysis.” Lisa knew that Max preferred vacationing near the ocean and had a strong desire to move operations to Wyatville. However, she was unable to find any errors in her analysis and could not identify any additional benefits.</p>
                <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch08_s08_p26">Lisa approached Max with this information. Max responded, “There is no way Kenton should have a higher net present value than Wyatville. Redo your analysis to show that Wyatville has the highest net present value, and have it on my desk by the end of the week.”</p>

                <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch08_s08_p28">Peggy Parkins, manager of the Light Truck Division, is considering investing in new production equipment. The net present value of the proposal is positive, and Peggy is convinced the new equipment will provide a competitive edge in future years. However, because of the significant up-front cost and related depreciation, short-term profits will be negatively affected by this investment. In fact, the new equipment will reduce return on investment below the 10 percent threshold for at least 3 years, which will prevent Peggy from receiving her annual bonuses for at least 3 years. However, profits are expected to increase significantly after the three-year period. Peggy is planning to retire in two years and therefore would prefer to reject the proposal to invest in new production equipment.</p>
