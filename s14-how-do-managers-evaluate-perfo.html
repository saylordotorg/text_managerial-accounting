Although this works well in the planning phase of budgeting, it is not appropriate for the control phase. Actual sales rarely match budgeted sales. When actual sales differ from budgeted sales, it is inappropriate and perhaps unfair to evaluate employee performance by comparing actual results to the master budget. If actual sales volume is higher than the master budget, variable costs should be higher than the master budget. The opposite is true as well. </em><em class="emphasis bolditalic">How do organizations modify the master budget to adjust for actual sales?</em></p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch10_s01_p02">Answer: Organizations use a modified budget called a <em class="emphasis">flexible budget</em>. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">flexible budget</a><span class="glossdef">A revised master budget based on the <em class="emphasis">actual</em> activity level.</span></span> is simply a revised master budget based on the <em class="emphasis">actual</em> activity level. It represents what costs <em class="emphasis">should be</em> given a certain level of activity. The master budget at Jerry’s Ice Cream was based on sales of 200,000 units and production of 200,400 units. Because actual sales totaled 210,000 units, the flexible budget should be based on 210,000 units of activity. (It should be noted that in <a class="xref" href="heisinger_1.0-ch09#heisinger_1.0-ch09">Chapter 9 "How Are Operating Budgets Created?"</a>, we presented an example with budgeted sales of 200,000 units and budgeted production of 200,400 units resulting from differing beginning and ending finished goods inventory amounts. In this chapter, we assume beginning and ending finished goods inventory are the same, and therefore units produced and sold will be the same. Thus we assume actual sales and actual production total 210,000 units.)</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch10_s01_p04">Answer: Probably not. The budget should be adjusted upward to reflect the actual number of units produced before a comparison is made, thus the term <em class="emphasis">flexible budget</em>. As we develop the process of cost variance analysis, we will use flexible budget information. That is, we will revise the master budget for direct materials, direct labor, and variable manufacturing overhead to reflect actual sales volume of 210,000 units. However, we must first describe the concept of <em class="emphasis">standard cost</em>.</p>

        <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch10_s01_p06">A flexible budget is a revised master budget based on the actual activity level achieved for a period. The master budget is established before the period begins for planning purposes, and the flexible budget is established after the period ends for control and evaluation purposes. Production managers are evaluated using the flexible budget because the usage of direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead will depend on the actual number of units produced.</p>

            <p class="simpara">The Effect of Rising Materials Costs on Auto Suppliers</p>
            <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch10_s03_s03_p08">In the first six months of 2004, steel prices increased 76 percent, from $350 a ton to $617 a ton. For auto suppliers that use hundreds of tons of steel each year, this had the unexpected effect of increasing expenses and reducing profits. For example, a major producer of automotive wheels had to reduce its annual earnings forecast by $10,000,000 to $15,000,000 as a result of the increase in steel prices.</p>
            <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch10_s03_s03_p09">Most auto part suppliers operate with very small margins. <strong class="emphasis bold">GR Spring and Stamping, Inc.</strong>, a supplier of stampings to automotive companies, was generating pretax profit margins of about 3 percent prior to the increase in steel prices. Profit margins have been cut in half since steel prices began rising.</p>
            <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch10_s03_s03_p10">These thin margins are the reason auto suppliers examine direct materials variances so carefully. Any unexpected increase in steel prices will likely cause significant unfavorable materials price variances, which will lead to lower profits. Auto part suppliers that rely on steel will continue to scrutinize materials price variances and materials quantity variances to control costs, particularly in a period of rising steel prices.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch10_s05_s03_p05">Again, this analysis is appropriate assuming direct labor hours truly drives the use of variable overhead activities. That is, we assume that an increase in direct labor hours will increase variable overhead costs and that a decrease in direct labor hours will decrease variable overhead costs.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch10_s06_p04">Answer: Some managers might review all unfavorable variances. However, the variable overhead spending variance of $5,500 is not very significant relative to the other variances and may not be worth investigating. Also, by focusing solely on unfavorable variances, managers might overlook problems that may result from favorable variances.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch10_s06_p05">Another approach might be to investigate all favorable and unfavorable variances above a certain minimum level, calculated as a percent of the flexible budget amount. For example, management could establish a policy to investigate all variances at or above 10 percent of the flexible budget amount for each cost. At Jerry’s Ice Cream, this would mean investigating all variances at or above $42,000 for direct materials (= 10 percent × $420,000), $27,300 for direct labor (= 10 percent × $273,000), and $10,500 for variable overhead (= 10 percent × $105,000). Based on this policy, the following variances would be investigated:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch10_s06_l02">
        <li>Unfavorable direct materials price variance of $88,000 (≥ $42,000 minimum)</li>
        <li>Unfavorable direct labor rate variance of $37,800 (≥ $27,300 minimum)</li>
        <li>Favorable direct labor efficiency variance of $(27,300) (≥ $27,300 minimum)</li>
        <li>Favorable variable overhead efficiency variance of $(10,500) (≥ $10,500 minimum)</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch10_s06_p06">Many companies calculate and investigate variances weekly, monthly, or quarterly and focus on trends. In this case, they may only investigate variances that are unfavorable and increasing over time.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch10_s06_p07">Whatever the approach, managers understand that investigating variances requires resources. Thus managers must establish an efficient and cost-effective approach to analyzing variances by weighing the benefits derived from investigating variances against the costs incurred to perform the analysis.</p>

        <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch10_s06_p08">Variance analysis is not only an effective way to control costs; some companies, including <strong class="emphasis bold">The Dow Chemical Company</strong>, have found that investigating variances can also help them detect fraudulent activities. <strong class="emphasis bold">Dow</strong>, which provides chemical, plastic, and agricultural products to customers in 180 countries, has annual sales of $33,000,000,000 and approximately 46,000 employees. In 1998, the company created a department called Fraud Investigative Services (FIS) whose mission is to “deter and prevent incidents of fraud and financial abuse through detection, investigation, and education.”</p>
        <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch10_s06_p09">The most common types of fraud allegations reviewed by <strong class="emphasis bold">Dow’s</strong> FIS include expense report fraud, kickback schemes, and embezzlement. Paul Zikmund, the director of FIS, states that “unexplainable cost variances between budget and actual amounts” are among the warning signs he looks for in identifying fraud.</p>
        <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch10_s06_p10">For example, suppose the actual cost for direct materials is significantly higher than the budgeted cost. The cost accountant at <strong class="emphasis bold">Dow</strong> would begin investigating the cause of the variance by talking with the company’s purchasing agent. The purchasing agent might be unable (or unwilling) to explain why actual costs are so high. Further investigation might indicate that the purchasing agent was intentionally overbilling the vendor and receiving a kickback from the vendor.</p>
        <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch10_s06_p11">Zikmund states that for every $1 that <strong class="emphasis bold">Dow</strong> spends on investigating fraud, the company recovers nearly $4.

    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch10_s07_p07">This type of costing system and resulting variance analysis provides management with further information regarding variable overhead costs and variances. As discussed earlier, management often establishes criteria to decide which variances to investigate. Assume that management of Jerry’s Ice Cream chooses to investigate the $7,750 unfavorable efficiency variance associated with energy. The management would like to know why 575,000 minutes of actual machine time were used instead of the expected 420,000 minutes. Perhaps the machines were operating poorly due to cutbacks in maintenance, or maybe new employees were not as efficient using the machines. Whatever the cause, Jerry’s has identified the issue by integrating its activity-based costing system with the cost variance analysis concepts discussed in this chapter.</p>

Recall from earlier chapters that manufacturing companies are required to assign fixed manufacturing overhead costs to products for financial reporting purposes (this is called absorption costing). It is common for companies such as Jerry’s Ice Cream to apply fixed manufacturing overhead costs to products based on direct labor hours, machine hours, or some other activity. Companies using a standard costing system apply fixed overhead based on a standard dollar amount per unit produced (this calculation is shown in the footnote to <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch10_s08_f01">Figure 10.12 "Fixed Manufacturing Overhead Information for Jerry’s Ice Cream"</a>). Assume Jerry’s uses direct labor hours to assign fixed overhead costs to products shown in <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch10_s08_f01">Figure 10.12 "Fixed Manufacturing Overhead Information for Jerry’s Ice Cream"</a>. </em><em class="emphasis bolditalic">How is this information used to perform fixed overhead cost variance analysis?</em></p>
