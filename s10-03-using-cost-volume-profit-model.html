The column labeled <em class="emphasis">Scenario 1</em> shows that increasing the price by 10 percent will increase profit 87.5 percent ($17,500). Thus profit is highly sensitive to changes in sales price. Another way to look at this is that for every one percent <em class="emphasis">increase</em> in sales price, profit will <em class="emphasis">increase</em> by 8.75 percent, or for every one percent <em class="emphasis">decrease</em> in sales price, profit will <em class="emphasis">decrease</em> by 8.75 percent.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch06_s03_s01_p06">The column labeled <em class="emphasis">Scenario 2</em> shows that decreasing sales volume 10 percent will decrease profit 35 percent ($7,000).

        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch06_s03_s01_p07">When comparing Scenario 1 with Scenario 2, we see that Snowboard Company’s profit is more sensitive to changes in sales price than to changes in sales volume, although changes in either will significantly affect profit.</p>

Variable costs of $105,000 (cell D15) are calculated by multiplying the $150 variable cost per unit (cell D6) by 700 units (cell D8). Fixed costs of $50,000 come from the top section (cell D7). The contribution margin of $70,000 is calculated by subtracting variable costs from sales, and profit of $20,000 is calculated by subtracting fixed costs from the contribution margin.</p>

            <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch06_s03_s02_p06">Three entrepreneurs in California were looking for investors and banks to finance a new brewpub. Brewpubs focus on two segments: food from the restaurant segment, and freshly brewed beer from the beer production segment. All parties involved in the process of raising money—potential investors and banks, as well as the three entrepreneurs (i.e., the owners)—wanted to know what the new business’s projected profits would be. After months of research, the owners created a financial model that provided this information. Projected profits were slightly more than $300,000 for the first year (from sales of $1.95 million) and were expected to increase in each of the next four years.</p>
            <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch06_s03_s02_p07">One of the owners asked, “What if our projected revenues are too high? What will happen to profits if sales are lower than we expect? After all, we will have debt of well over $1 million, and I don’t want anyone coming after my personal assets if the business doesn’t have the money to pay!” Although all three owners felt the financial model was reasonably accurate, they decided to find the break-even point and the resulting margin of safety.</p>
            <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch06_s03_s02_p08">Because a brewpub does not sell “units” of a specific product, the owners found the break-even point in sales dollars. The owners knew the contribution margin ratio and all fixed costs from the financial model. With this information, they were able to calculate the break-even point and margin of safety. The worried owner was relieved to discover that sales could drop over 35 percent from initial projections before the brewpub incurred an operating loss.</p>
