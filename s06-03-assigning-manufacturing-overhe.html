For example, if a company’s production process is labor intensive (i.e., it requires a large labor force), overhead costs are likely driven by direct labor hours or direct labor costs. The more direct labor hours worked, the higher the overhead costs incurred. Thus direct labor hours or direct labor costs would be used as the allocation base.</p>
                    <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch02_s03_s01_s02_p03">If a company’s production process is highly mechanized (i.e., it relies on machinery more than on labor), overhead costs are likely driven by machine hours. The more machine hours used, the higher the overhead costs incurred. Thus machine hours would be used as the allocation base.</p>
                    <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch02_s03_s01_s02_p04">It may make more sense to use several allocation bases and several overhead rates to allocate overhead to jobs. This approach, called <em class="emphasis">activity-based costing</em>, is discussed in depth in <a class="xref" href="heisinger_1.0-ch03#heisinger_1.0-ch03">Chapter 3 "How Does an Organization Use Activity-Based Costing to Allocate Overhead Costs?"</a>.</p>

<strong class="emphasis bold">Ease of measurement.</strong> An allocation base should not only be linked to overhead costs; it should also be measurable. The three most common allocation bases—direct labor hours, direct labor costs, and machine hours—are relatively easy to measure. Direct labor hours and direct labor costs can be measured by using a timesheet, as discussed earlier, so using either of these as a base for allocating overhead is quite simple. Machine hours can also be easily measured by placing an hour meter on each machine if one does not already exist.</li>

        <p class="para block"> </p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch02_s03_s02_p02">Answer: Companies use normal costing for several reasons:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch02_s03_s02_l01">
            <li>Actual overhead costs can fluctuate from month to month, causing high amounts of overhead to be charged to jobs during high-cost periods. For example, utility costs might be higher during cold winter months and hot summer months than in the fall and spring seasons. Maintenance costs might be higher during slow periods. Normal costing averages these costs out over the course of a year.</li>
            <li>Actual overhead cost data are typically only available at the end of the month, quarter, or year. Managers prefer to know the cost of a job when it is completed—and in some cases during production—rather than waiting until the end of the period.</li>
            <li>The price charged to customers is often negotiated based on cost. A predetermined overhead rate is helpful when estimating costs.</li>
            <li>Bookkeeping is simplified by using a predetermined overhead rate. One rate is used to record overhead costs rather than tabulating actual overhead costs at the end of the reporting period and going back to assign the costs to jobs.</li>

            <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch02_s03_s04_p06">Since most of <strong class="emphasis bold">Boeing’s</strong> products are unique and costly, the company likely uses job costing to track costs associated with each product it manufactures. For example, the costly direct materials that go into each jetliner produced are tracked using a job cost sheet. Direct labor and manufacturing overhead costs (think huge production facilities!) are also assigned to each jetliner. This careful tracking of production costs for each jetliner provides management with important cost information that is used to assess production efficiency and profitability. Management can answer questions, such as “How much did direct materials cost?,” “How much overhead was allocated to each jetliner?,” or “What was the total production cost for each jetliner?” This is important information when it comes time to negotiate the sales price of a jetliner with a potential buyer like <strong class="emphasis bold">United Airlines</strong> or <strong class="emphasis bold">Southwest Airlines</strong>.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch02_s03_s04_s02_p01"><em class="emphasis">Question: Although most companies close the manufacturing overhead account to cost of goods sold, this is typically only done when the amount is immaterial (immaterial is a common accounting term used to describe an amount that is small relative to a company’s size). The term material describes a relatively large amount. </em><em class="emphasis bolditalic">How do we close the manufacturing overhead account when the amount is material?</em></p>
            <p class="para block"> </p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch02_s03_s04_s02_p02">Answer: If the amount is material, it should be closed to three different accounts—work-in-process (WIP) inventory, finished goods inventory, and cost of goods sold—in proportion to the account balances in these accounts.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch02_s03_s04_s02_p03">For example, suppose a company has $2,000 in underapplied overhead (debit balance in manufacturing overhead) and that the three account balances are as follows:</p>
            <div class="informalfigure large block">
                <img src="section_06/fe8d80cba64257ef03c89a3733870a4b.jpg">

            <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch02_s03_s04_s02_p04">The $2,000 is closed to each of the three accounts based on their respective percentages. Thus $1,200 is apportioned to WIP inventory (= $2,000 × 60 percent), $600 goes to finished goods inventory (= $2,000 × 30 percent), and $200 goes to cost of goods sold (= $2,000 × 10 percent). The journal entry to close the $2,000 underapplied overhead debit balance in manufacturing overhead is as follows:</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch02_s03_s04_s02_p05">Although this approach is not as common as simply closing the manufacturing overhead account balance to cost of goods sold, companies do this when the amount is relatively significant.</p>
