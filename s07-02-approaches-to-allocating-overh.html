When </em><em class="emphasis bolditalic">Hewlett-Packard </em><em class="emphasis">produces printers, the company has three possible methods that can be used to allocate overhead costs to products—plantwide allocation, department allocation, and activity-based allocation (called activity-based costing). </em><em class="emphasis bolditalic">How do managers decide which allocation method to use?</em></p>
    <p class="para block"> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch03_s02_p02">Answer: The choice of an allocation method depends on how managers decide to group overhead costs and the desired accuracy of product cost information. Groups of overhead costs are called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">cost pools</a><span class="glossdef">A collection of overhead costs, typically organized by department or activity.</span></span>. For example, <strong class="emphasis bold">Hewlett Packard’s</strong> printer production division may choose to collect all factory overhead costs in one cost pool and allocate those costs from the cost pool to each product using one predetermined overhead rate. Or <strong class="emphasis bold">Hewlett Packard</strong> may choose to have several cost pools (perhaps for each department, such as assembly, packaging, and quality control) and allocate overhead costs from each department cost pool to products using a separate predetermined overhead rate for each department. In general, the more cost pools used, the more accurate the allocation process.</p>

You learned about this approach in <a class="xref" href="heisinger_1.0-ch02#heisinger_1.0-ch02">Chapter 2 "How Is Job Costing Used to Track Production Costs?"</a> where one predetermined rate—typically based on direct labor hours, direct labor costs, or machine hours—was used to allocate overhead costs. (Remember, the focus here is on the allocation of overhead costs. Direct materials and direct labor are easily traced to the product and therefore are not a part of the overhead allocation process.)</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch03_s02_s01_p04">Using SailRite Company as an example, assume annual overhead costs are estimated to be $8,000,000 and direct labor hours are used for the plantwide allocation base. Management estimates that a total of 250,000 direct labor hours are worked annually. These estimates are based on the previous year’s overhead costs and direct labor hours and are adjusted for expected increases in demand the coming year. The predetermined overhead rate is $32 per direct labor hour (= $8,000,000 ÷ 250,000 direct labor hours). Thus, as shown in <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch03_s02_s01_f01">Figure 3.1 "Using One Plantwide Rate to Allocate SailRite Company’s Overhead"</a>, products are charged $32 in overhead costs for each direct labor hour worked.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch03_s02_s01_s01_p02">Answer: The calculation of a product’s cost involves three components—direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead. Assume direct materials cost $1,000 for one unit of the Basic sailboat and $1,300 for the Deluxe. Direct labor costs are $600 for one unit of the Basic sailboat and $750 for the Deluxe. This information, combined with the overhead cost per unit, gives us what we need to determine the product cost per unit for each model.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch03_s02_s01_s01_p03">Given the predetermined overhead rate of $32 per direct labor hour calculated in the previous section, and assuming it takes 40 hours of direct labor to build one Basic sailboat and 50 hours to build one Deluxe sailboat, we can calculate the manufacturing overhead cost per unit. Manufacturing overhead cost per unit is $1,280 (= $32 × 40 direct labor hours) for the Basic boat and $1,600 (= $32 × 50 direct labor hours) for the Deluxe boat. Combine the manufacturing overhead with direct materials and direct labor, as shown in <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch03_s02_s01_s01_f01">Figure 3.2 "SailRite Company Product Costs Using One Plantwide Rate Based on Direct Labor Hours"</a>, and we are able to calculate the product cost per unit.</p>

Management may not want more accurate product cost information or may not have the resources to implement a more complex accounting system. As we move on to more complex costing systems, remember that these systems are more expensive to implement. Thus the benefits of having improved cost information must outweigh the costs of obtaining the information.</p>

        <p class="para block"> </p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch03_s02_s02_p02">Answer: The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">department allocation</a><span class="glossdef">A method of allocating costs that uses a separate cost pool, and therefore a separate predetermined overhead rate, for each department.</span></span> approach is similar to the plantwide approach except that cost pools are formed for each department rather than for the entire plant, and a separate predetermined overhead rate is established for each department. Remember, total estimated overhead costs will not change. Instead, they will be broken out into various department cost pools. This approach allows for the use of different allocation bases for different departments depending on what drives overhead costs for each department. For example, the Hull Fabrication department at SailRite Company may find that overhead costs are driven more by the use of machinery than by labor, and therefore decides to use machine hours as the allocation base. The Assembly department may find that overhead costs are driven more by labor activity than by machine use and therefore decides to use labor hours or labor costs as the allocation base.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch03_s02_s02_p03">Assume that SailRite is considering using the department approach rather than the plantwide approach for allocating overhead. The cost pool in the Hull Fabrication department is estimated to be $3,000,000 for the year, and the cost pool in the Assembly department is estimated at $5,000,000. Note that total estimated overhead cost is still $8,000,000 (= $3,000,000 + $5,000,000). Machine hours (estimated at 60,000 hours) will be used as the allocation base for Hull Fabrication, and direct labor hours (estimated at 217,000 hours) will be used as the allocation base for Assembly. Thus two rates are used to allocate overhead (rounded to the nearest dollar) as follows:</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch03_s02_s02_p04">As shown in <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch03_s02_s02_f01">Figure 3.3 "Using Department Rates to Allocate SailRite Company’s Overhead"</a>, products going through the Hull Fabrication department are charged $50 in overhead costs for each <em class="emphasis">machine hour</em> used.

        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch03_s02_s02_p05">The department allocation approach allows cost pools to be formed for each department and provides for flexibility in the selection of an allocation base. Although <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch03_s02_s02_f01">Figure 3.3 "Using Department Rates to Allocate SailRite Company’s Overhead"</a> shows just two rates, many companies have more than two departments and therefore more than two rates. Organizations that use this approach tend to have simple operations within each department but different activities across departments. One department may use machinery, while another department may use labor, as is the case with SailRite’s two departments. This approach typically provides more accurate cost information than simply using one plantwide rate but still relies on the assumption that overhead costs are driven by direct labor hours, direct labor costs, or machine hours. This assumption of a causal relationship is increasingly less realistic as production processes become more complex.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch03_s02_s02_p06">The plantwide and department allocation methods are “traditional” approaches because both typically use direct labor hours, direct labor costs, or machine hours as the allocation base, and both were used prior to the creation of activity-based costing in the 1980s.</p>
