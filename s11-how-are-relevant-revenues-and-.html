    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch07_p01">Bob Lee is president of Best Boards, Inc., a manufacturer of wakeboards. In the face of stiff competition, Best Boards’ profits have declined steadily over the past few years. Bob is concerned about the decline in profits and has instructed Jim Muller, the vice president of operations, to do whatever it takes to reduce costs. In fact, Bob offered to pay Jim a bonus equal to 25 percent of any production cost savings the company achieves during the coming year.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch07_p02">Jim Muller thinks he has a way to cut costs and earn his bonus, and he approaches Bob Lee and Amy Eckstrom, the company’s accountant, to discuss his plan:</p>

Management believes Phillips Accountancy has several unprofitable customers and would like to perform differential analysis to find out how profits would change if Phillips dropped these customers.

    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch07_s01_p03">Answer: <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch07_s01_f01">Figure 7.1 "Differential Analysis for Phillips Accountancy"</a> presents the format used by management to perform differential analysis. In this case, differential analysis is used to evaluate whether Phillips Accounting should keep all customers or drop unprofitable customers. The information in <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch07_s01_f01">Figure 7.1 "Differential Analysis for Phillips Accountancy"</a> confirms that Phillips Accountancy would be better off dropping the unprofitable customers (Alternative 2), because company profits would increase by $20,000. The general rule is to select the alternative with the highest differential profit. Take a close look at <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch07_s01_f01">Figure 7.1 "Differential Analysis for Phillips Accountancy"</a> before reading the description of this information that follows.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch07_s01_p04">Notice that in <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch07_s01_f01">Figure 7.1 "Differential Analysis for Phillips Accountancy"</a> the columns labeled <em class="emphasis">Alternative 1</em> and <em class="emphasis">Alternative 2</em> show revenues, costs, and profit for each alternative. The third column, labeled <em class="emphasis">Differential Amount</em>, presents the differential revenues and costs and resulting differential profit. Positive amounts appearing in this column indicate Alternative 1 is higher than Alternative 2. Negative amounts appearing in the <em class="emphasis">Differential Amount</em> column indicate Alternative 1 is lower than Alternative 2. The fourth column shows whether Alternative 1 is higher or lower than Alternative 2 for each line item.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch07_s01_p05">For example, the differential amount of $1,000,000 for revenue indicates Alternative 1 produces $1,000,000 more in revenue than Alternative 2. The differential amount of $750,000 for variable costs indicates variable costs are $750,000 higher for Alternative 1 than for Alternative 2. Move to the bottom of <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch07_s01_f01">Figure 7.1 "Differential Analysis for Phillips Accountancy"</a>. Notice that the differential amount for profit is negative ($20,000). This indicates that Alternative 1 results in profits that are $20,000 lower than Alternative 2. Thus Alternative 2 (dropping unprofitable customers) is the desirable course of action.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch07_s01_p06">Notice that the columns labeled <em class="emphasis">Alternative 1</em> and <em class="emphasis">Alternative 2</em> show information in summary form (i.e., no detail is provided for revenues, variable costs, or fixed costs). Some managers may want only this type of summary information, whereas others may prefer more detailed information. It is important to be flexible with the format, to best meet the needs of managers. We will build upon the differential analysis format shown in <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch07_s01_f01">Figure 7.1 "Differential Analysis for Phillips Accountancy"</a> throughout this chapter, and show how more detail can easily be provided using the same format.</p>

However, the retail store rent likely will not decrease if the charcoal barbecues product line is eliminated (unless the company chooses to move to a smaller, less costly store).

However, it saves variable costs of $40,000 and direct fixed costs of $40,000 if it drops the charcoal barbecues product line. Because the $80,000 in cost savings is not enough to make up for the $90,000 loss in sales revenue, profit will decline by $10,000 (= $80,000 − $90,000).</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch07_s03_s01_p01"><em class="emphasis">Question: </em><em class="emphasis bolditalic">How can the charcoal barbecues product line show a loss of $8,000 in <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch07_s03_f03">Figure 7.6 "Product Line Differential Analysis for Barbeque Company"</a>, while the company as a whole is better off keeping this product line?</em></p>
        <p class="para block"> </p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch07_s03_s01_p02">Answer: The answer lies within allocated fixed costs. Even though total allocated fixed costs of $120,000 cannot easily be traced to each product line, company management wants each product line manager to be aware of these costs. As a result, it uses an allocation process to assign the costs to product lines. Thus the charcoal barbecues product line is assigned $18,000 in allocated fixed costs even though these costs cannot be controlled by the product line. If the charcoal barbecues product line is eliminated, $18,000 in allocated fixed costs is not eliminated. Instead, $18,000 in costs is assigned to the other two product lines.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch07_s03_s01_p03">In many situations, this increased allocation to other product lines may cause other product lines to appear unprofitable. The message here is to be careful when analyzing segmented information containing cost allocations. Allocated costs are typically not differential costs, and therefore are typically not relevant to the decision.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch07_s03_s01_p04">An alternative view of the decision facing Barbeque Company—whether to keep or drop the charcoal barbecues product line—is simply to calculate profitability of this product line <em class="emphasis">before</em> deducting allocated fixed costs. <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch07_s03_f03">Figure 7.6 "Product Line Differential Analysis for Barbeque Company"</a> shows a contribution margin of $50,000 for charcoal barbecues. Deduct direct fixed costs of $40,000 and this product line has a remaining profit of $10,000. This explains why Barbeque Company’s overall profit would be $10,000 lower if the charcoal barbecues product line were eliminated. (As discussed previously, the allocated fixed costs are irrelevant to this decision.)</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch07_s04_s02_p01"><em class="emphasis">Question: Activity-based costing, which we discussed in <a class="xref" href="heisinger_1.0-ch03#heisinger_1.0-ch03">Chapter 3 "How Does an Organization Use Activity-Based Costing to Allocate Overhead Costs?"</a>, is a refined approach to allocating costs to products or customers. Activity-based costing first assigns costs to activities and then to products or customers based on their use of the activities. The cost information provided by activity-based costing is generally regarded as more accurate than most traditional costing methods. </em><em class="emphasis bolditalic">How can using activity-based costing information with differential analysis lead to better decisions in areas such as product lines and customer profitability?</em></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch07_s04_s02_p02">Answer: Let’s look at a brief example of how activity-based costing can help with customer profitability. When assessing customer profitability, costs can be assigned to customers based on each customer’s use of activities. Consultants from <strong class="emphasis bold">PricewaterhouseCoopers</strong> suggest that customer costs are measurable across four categories of activities:<span class="footnote" id="heisinger_1.0-fn07_001">Joseph A.

A significant advantage of using activity-based costing is having accurate data for decision-making purposes, particularly in the area of differential analysis.</p>

For example, a five-year lease on a warehouse used solely for one product line is a direct fixed cost but not a differential cost because the costs will continue even if the product line is eliminated.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch07_s05_p06"><em class="emphasis">Allocated fixed costs</em>—fixed costs that cannot be traced directly to a product—are typically <em class="emphasis">not</em> differential costs.

The first assumption is that Tony’s has enough idle capacity to handle the order without disrupting regular customer orders. Suppose Tony’s T-shirts is operating at capacity and cannot produce any more T-shirts. Tony must turn away regular customers to make room for the special order. In this scenario, the opportunity cost of turning away existing customers must be considered in the differential analysis.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch07_s06_s02_p03">The second assumption is that this is a one-time order, and therefore represents a short-run pricing decision. If Tony’s T-shirts expects future orders from the high school at the $17 per shirt price, the company must consider the impact this might have on long-run pricing with other customers. That is, regular customers may hear of this special price and demand the same price, particularly those customers who have been loyal to Tony’s T-shirts for many years. Tony’s might be forced to lower prices for regular customers, thereby eroding the company’s profits over time. The key point is that companies evaluating special orders can drop prices in the short run to cover differential variable and fixed costs. But in the long run, prices must cover all variable and fixed costs.</p>

For example, a defense contractor working with the government assumes the cost to build a new fighter jet is $60 million. As there is no open market price for this product, the contractor must come up with an approach to establishing the price that does not rely on market pricing. Based on industry-wide standards and negotiations with the government, the contractor requests a 10 percent markup on cost. If the government accepts this proposal, the contractor will receive $66 million for each plane delivered [$66 million = $60 million + ($60 million × 10 percent)].</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch07_s07_s01_p03">The concept of cost-plus pricing sounds simple. However, the difficulty is in determining which costs should be included. Are only variable product costs included? Should fixed manufacturing overhead be included? What about selling costs? The answers to these questions depend on the negotiations between buyer and seller, and should be clearly defined in the agreement. When using cost-plus pricing, it is important to establish in advance which costs are to be included for pricing purposes.</p>

The management at Computers, Inc., has identified department 4, quality testing, as the bottleneck because assembled computers are backing up at department 4. Quality testing cannot be performed fast enough to keep up with the inflow of computers coming from departments 1, 2, and 3. A limitation of labor hours available to perform testing is causing this backlog.</p>

At this point, Computers, Inc., would like to optimize the labor hours used for quality testing. To assist in this goal, we will calculate the contribution margin per unit of constraint (the unit of constraint is <em class="emphasis">labor hour</em> in this example). Production will then focus on products with the highest contribution margin per labor hour. <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch07_s08_f02">Figure 7.16 "Contribution Margin per Unit of Constrained Resource for Computers, Inc."</a> provides this information for each product.

    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch07_s08_p14">Management’s goal is to loosen the constraint by providing more labor hours to department 4. For example, management may decide to move employees from departments 1, 2, and 3 to the quality testing department. Another option is to authorize overtime for the workers in department 4. Perhaps management will consider hiring additional workers for department 4.</p>

            <li>Most companies have limited resources in areas such as labor hours, machine hours, facilities, and materials. The theory of constraints is an approach that enables companies to optimize the use of limited resources. Five steps are involved. First, find the constrained resource (or bottleneck). Second, optimize the use of the constrained resource. Third, subordinate all nonbottleneck resources to the bottleneck. Fourth, increase bottleneck efficiency and capacity. Fifth, repeat the first four steps for the new bottleneck.</li>

Using these quantitative factors to make decisions allows managers to support decisions with measurable data. For example, the idea of outsourcing production of wakeboards at Best Boards, Inc., presented at the beginning of the chapter, was rejected because it was more costly to outsource production of the boards than to produce them internally. Although using quantitative factors for decision making is important, management must also consider qualitative factors. </em><em class="emphasis bolditalic">How might the consideration of qualitative factors improve decisions made by managers?</em></p>
    <p class="para block"> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch07_s09_p02">Answer: Qualitative factors may outweigh the quantitative factors in making a decision. For example, assume management at Best Boards, Inc., believes there will be a decline in the market for wakeboards after next year. Outsourcing production makes it easier to quickly reduce costs in the face of a downturn by simply ordering fewer wakeboards from the supplier. Continuing to build the boards internally takes away this flexibility. The significant fixed costs often associated with manufacturing firms are difficult to reduce in the short run if production declines. Thus the qualitative factor of being able to reduce manufacturing costs quickly by outsourcing production may outweigh the quantitative factors shown in <a class="xref" href="heisinger_1.0-ch07_s02#heisinger_1.0-ch07_s02_s02_f01">Figure 7.3 "Summary of Differential Analysis for Best Boards, Inc."</a> and <a class="xref" href="heisinger_1.0-ch07_s03#heisinger_1.0-ch07_s03_f01">Figure 7.4 "Product Line Decision"</a>.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch07_s09_p04">Answer: Management must consider whether product quality would remain the same. Financial stability of the producer must be considered as well. It does no good to outsource production and eliminate production facilities and employees if the producer being used suddenly shuts down. Also, employee morale tends to slide if employees in one segment of a company are fired. This can lead to an unhappy and inefficient workforce in other areas of the company, causing costs to rise. These are just a few of the qualitative factors that must be weighed against quantitative factors when performing differential analysis.</p>

            <ul class="itemizedlist" id="heisinger_1.0-ch07_s10_s03_l01">
                <li>Two or more products made from a single input are called joint products. The costs of the single input and related manufacturing process costs must be allocated to each of the joint products. The physical quantities method allocates joint costs based on a physical measure of output (e.g., pounds or yards of material). The sales value method allocates joint costs based on the relative sales value for each of the joint products. Regardless of the allocation method used, total joint costs and total profit remain the same. Companies must often decide whether to process a joint product further. If as a result of processing the product further, additional sales revenue exceeds additional costs, the wise decision is to process further.</li>
