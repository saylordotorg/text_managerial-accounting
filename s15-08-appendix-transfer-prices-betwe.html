If division managers are evaluated based only on division results using measures, such as segmented net income, profit margin ratio, or return on investment (ROI), conflicts can arise causing managers to take a course of action that benefits the division but hurts the company as a whole. For example, a division manager may decide to purchase raw materials from an outside supplier even though the same materials can be produced at a lower cost by another division within the company (the other division’s manager refuses to sell the materials at a reduced price because she is evaluated based on her division’s profits!). </em><em class="emphasis bolditalic">How should a company establish transfer pricing to avoid this kind of conflict?</em></p>
    <p class="para block"> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch11_s08_p02">Answer: The price used to value the transfer of goods or services between divisions within the same company is called a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">transfer price</a><span class="glossdef">The value assigned to the transfer of goods or services between divisions within the same company.</span></span>. Several different approaches can be used to establish transfer prices between divisions. The goal is to establish a transfer pricing policy that encourages managers to do what is in the best interest of the company while also doing what is in the best interest of the division manager (this is called <em class="emphasis">goal congruence</em>).

        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch11_s08_s01_p02">Answer: The general economic transfer pricing rule attempts to establish guidelines for divisions to maximize overall company profit. This rule states the transfer price should be set at differential cost to the selling division (normally variable cost), plus the opportunity cost of making the sale internally (none if the seller has idle capacity or selling price minus differential cost if the seller is at capacity).

        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch11_s08_s01_p03">Let’s look at an example illustrating how to establish a reasonable transfer price using the economic transfer pricing rule. Umbrellas, Inc., has two divisions—Assembly and Marketing. In the past, all transfers of umbrellas from Assembly to Marketing were valued at the variable cost of $6 each. However, the Assembly division manager would like to raise the price to $9 per unit.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch11_s08_s01_p04">Which transfer price should be used to maximize company profit, $6 or $9? The answer depends on whether the selling division (Assembly) is below capacity or at capacity.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch11_s08_s01_s01_p05">If Assembly sets the transfer price higher than $6 per unit ($9 for example), thereby violating the economic transfer pricing rule, the risk is that Marketing might find another company willing to provide the umbrellas for an amount less than $9 and higher than $6. If Marketing chooses to buy umbrellas from an outside supplier for $7, for example, profit declines at Umbrella, Inc., because the company paid $1 more than necessary for each umbrella ($1 = $7 outside supplier price − $6 Umbrella, Inc.’s variable cost). Although Marketing looks better as an investment center buying from the outside for $7 because the cost is $2 less than the internal transfer price, the overall company is worse off because the $7 cost is $1 higher than if the umbrellas were produced internally.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch11_s08_s02_p02">Answer: Transfer prices can be based on variable cost, full absorption cost, or cost-plus. Each approach is described next.</p>
        <div class="section" id="heisinger_1.0-ch11_s08_s02_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Variable Cost</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch11_s08_s02_s01_p01">Some companies simply use the selling division’s variable cost as the transfer price. However, the weakness in this approach is the selling division will not be able to mark up its products or services, and as a result, will not be able to generate a profit. This is not a problem for selling divisions treated as cost centers, but profit center and investment center managers will not be satisfied with such an approach.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch11_s08_s02_s02_p01">Companies sometimes set the transfer price at the selling division’s full absorption cost. The selling division manager prefers to cover all costs rather than only variable costs, and using full-absorption cost accomplishes this goal. However, the company’s concern is the buying division might choose to purchase from an outside provider at a higher price than the differential cost plus opportunity cost but lower than the selling division’s full absorption cost. The result is a decision that does not maximize company profit.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch11_s08_s02_s03_p01">Companies often add a markup to the selling division’s variable cost or full absorption cost to set the transfer price. This enables the selling division to earn a profit on internal transfers. Again, the risk is that the buying division might buy from an outside supplier at a higher price than differential cost plus opportunity cost, resulting in lower company profit.</p>

        <p class="para block"> </p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch11_s08_s03_p02">Answer: Investment center division managers are often expected to act independent of each other. In fact, many companies treat investment centers as separate businesses. To promote the autonomy of each division manager, companies often require the buying and selling divisions to negotiate a transfer price. This sounds reasonable in concept, but the same weakness exists here as with using costs to set a transfer price. The buying division may choose to purchase the goods or services from an outside supplier if negotiations break down, which may lead to a suboptimal decision for the company as a whole.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch11_s08_s03_p03">An additional weakness is the time required to negotiate a transfer price. Managers can spend significant amounts of time in negotiations when the time might be better spent more productively elsewhere in the division.</p>

No two companies are identical, and the choice of a transfer pricing policy depends largely on the nature of the company. The most common approaches used in industry are presented in this appendix. The goal is to establish a transfer pricing policy that encourages managers to do what is in the best interest of the company while also serving the best interest of the division manager.</p>
