Some costs will not change at all with a change in sales volume (e.g., monthly rent for the production facility). Some costs will change with a change in sales volume (e.g., materials for the mountain bikes). </em><em class="emphasis bolditalic">What are the three cost behavior patterns that help organizations identify which costs will change and which will remain the same with changes in sales volume?</em></p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Variable Costs</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch05_s01_s01_p01"><em class="emphasis">Question: We know that some costs vary with changes in activity. </em><em class="emphasis bolditalic">What do we call this type of cost behavior?</em></p>
        <p class="para block"> </p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch05_s01_s01_p02">Answer: This cost behavior pattern is called a variable cost. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">variable cost</a><span class="glossdef">A cost that varies in total with changes in activity and remains constant on a per unit basis with changes in activity.</span></span> describes a cost that <em class="emphasis">varies in total</em> with changes in volume of activity. The activity in this example is the number of bikes produced and sold. However, the activity can take many different forms depending on the organization. The two most common variable costs are direct materials and direct labor. Other examples include indirect materials and energy costs.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch05_s01_s01_p03">Assume the cost of direct materials (wheels, seats, frames, and so forth) for each bike at Bikes Unlimited is $40. If Bikes Unlimited produces one bike, <em class="emphasis">total</em> variable cost for direct materials amounts to $40. If Bikes Unlimited doubles its production to two bikes, total variable cost for direct materials also doubles to $80. Variable costs typically change in proportion to changes in volume of activity. If volume of activity doubles, total variable costs also double, while the cost per unit remains the same. It is important to note that the term <em class="emphasis">variable</em> refers to what happens to <em class="emphasis">total costs</em> with changes in activity, not to the cost per unit.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch05_s01_s01_p04">Taking it one step further for Bikes Unlimited, let’s consider all variable costs related to production. Assume direct materials, direct labor, and all other variable production costs amount to $60 per unit. <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch05_s01_s01_t01">Table 5.1 "Variable Cost Behavior for Bikes Unlimited"</a> provides the total and per unit variable costs at three different levels of production, and <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch05_s01_s01_f01">Figure 5.1 "Total Variable Production Costs for Bikes Unlimited"</a> graphs the relation of total variable costs (<em class="emphasis">y</em>-axis) to units produced (<em class="emphasis">x</em>-axis). Note that the slope of the line represents the variable cost per unit of $60 (slope = change in variable cost ÷ change in units produced).</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch05_s01_s01_s01_p02">Answer: The type of activity used to estimate variable costs depends on the cost. For example, a law firm might use the <em class="emphasis">number of labor hours</em> to estimate labor costs. An airline such as <strong class="emphasis bold">American Airlines</strong> might use <em class="emphasis">hours of flying time</em> to estimate fuel costs. A mail delivery service such as <strong class="emphasis bold">UPS</strong> might use the <em class="emphasis">number of packages processed</em> to estimate labor costs associated with sorting packages.

        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_p01"><em class="emphasis">Question: Costs that vary in total with changes in activity are called variable costs. </em><em class="emphasis bolditalic">What do we call costs that remain the same in total with changes in activity?</em></p>
        <p class="para block"> </p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_p02">Answer: This cost behavior pattern is called a fixed cost. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">fixed cost</a><span class="glossdef">A cost that remains constant in total with changes in activity and varies on a per unit basis with changes in activity.</span></span> describes a cost that is <em class="emphasis">fixed (does not change) in total</em> with changes in volume of activity. Assuming the activity is the number of bikes produced and sold, examples of fixed costs include salaried personnel, building rent, and insurance.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_p03">Assume Bikes Unlimited pays $8,000 per month in rent for its production facility. In addition, insurance for the same building is $2,000 per month and salaried production personnel are paid $6,000 per month. All other fixed production costs total $4,000. Thus Bikes Unlimited has total fixed costs of $20,000 per month related to its production facility (= $8,000 + $2,000 + $6,000 + $4,000). If only one bike is produced, Bikes Unlimited still must pay $20,000 per month. If 5,000 bikes are produced, Bikes Unlimited still pays $20,000 per month. The fixed costs remain unchanged in total as the level of activity changes.</p>

        <p class="para block"> </p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_p05">Answer: If Bikes Unlimited only produces one bike, the fixed cost <em class="emphasis">per unit</em> would amount to $20,000 (= $20,000 total fixed costs ÷ 1 bike). If Bikes Unlimited produces two bikes, the fixed cost per unit would be $10,000 (= $20,000 ÷ 2 bikes). As activity increases, the fixed costs are spread out over more units, which results in a lower cost per unit.</p>

These costs total $11.1 billion, or 60 percent of total operating expenses (rounded).

For example, assume Bikes Unlimited contributes $10,000 each year toward charitable organizations. Management has the option of changing this amount in the short run without causing a significant impact on the organization. Other examples of discretionary fixed costs include advertising, research and development, and training programs (although an argument can be made that reducing these expenditures could have a significant impact on the company depending on the amount of the cuts).</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_s01_p04">In general, management looks to cut discretionary fixed costs when sales and profits are declining, since cuts in this area tend not to have as significant an impact on the organization as cutting committed fixed costs. Difficulties arise when struggling organizations go beyond cutting discretionary fixed costs and begin looking at cutting committed fixed costs.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch05_s01_s04_s01_p02">Answer: Variable, fixed, and mixed cost concepts are useful for short-term decision making and therefore apply to a specific period of time. This short-term period will vary depending on the company’s current production capacity and the time required to change capacity. In the long term, all cost behavior patterns will likely change.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch05_s01_s04_s01_p03">For example, suppose Bikes Unlimited’s production capacity is 8,000 units per month, and management plans to expand capacity in two years by renting a new production facility and hiring additional personnel. This is a long-term decision that will change the cost behavior patterns identified earlier. Variable production costs will no longer be $60 per unit, fixed production costs will no longer be $20,000 per month, and mixed sales compensation costs will also change. All these costs will change because the estimates are accurate only in the short term.</p>

The variable, fixed, and mixed costs identified for Bikes Unlimited will only be accurate within a certain range of activity. Once the firm goes outside that range, cost estimates are not necessarily accurate and often must be reevaluated and recalculated.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch05_s01_s04_s02_p03">For example, assume Bikes Unlimited’s mixed sales compensation costs of $10,000 per month plus $7 per unit is only valid up to 4,000 units per month. If unit sales increase beyond 4,000 units, management will hire additional salespeople and the total monthly base salary will increase beyond $10,000. Thus the relevant range for this mixed cost is from zero to 4,000 units. Once the company exceeds sales of 4,000 units per month, it is out of the relevant range, and the mixed cost must be recalculated.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch05_s01_s04_s02_p04">We discuss the relevant range concept in more detail later in the chapter. For now, remember that the accuracy of cost behavior patterns is limited to a certain range of activity called the relevant range.</p>

                <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch05_s01_s04_s03_p04">A school district outside Sacramento, California, was faced with making budget cuts because of a reduction in state funding. To reduce costs, the school district’s administration decided to consider closing one of the smaller elementary schools in the district. According to an initial estimate, closing this school would reduce costs by $500,000 to $1,000,000 per year. However, further analysis identified only $100,000 to $150,000 in cost savings.</p>
                <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch05_s01_s04_s03_p05">Why did the analysis yield lower savings than the initial estimate? Most of the costs were committed fixed costs (e.g., teachers’ salaries and benefits) and could not be eliminated in the short term. In fact, teachers and students at the school being considered for closure were to be moved to other schools in the district, and so no savings on teachers’ salaries and benefits would result. The only real short-term cost savings would be in not having to maintain the classrooms, computer lab, and library (nonunion employees would be let go) and in utilities (heat and air conditioning would be turned off).</p>
                <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch05_s01_s04_s03_p06">The school district ultimately decided not to close the school because of the large committed fixed costs involved, as well as a lack of community support, and budget cuts were made in other areas throughout the district.</p>
