This is a reasonable assumption for not-for-profit entities and governmental agencies.

    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch08_s07_p02">Answer: Let’s look at an example to help explain how this works. The management of Scientific Products, Inc. (SPI), is considering a five-year contract to build scientific instruments for a large school district. The initial investment required to purchase production equipment is $400,000 (to be depreciated over 5 years using the straight-line method, with no salvage value). An additional $50,000 in working capital is required for the contract. Working capital will be returned to SPI at the end of five years. Annual <em class="emphasis">net</em> cash receipts from daily operations (cash receipts minus cash payments) are shown as follows. Since depreciation expense is not a cash outflow, it is <em class="emphasis">not</em> included in these amounts.</p>

        <ul class="itemizedlist" id="heisinger_1.0-ch08_s07_l07">
            <li>Companies that pay income taxes must consider the impact income taxes have on cash flows for long-term investments, and make the necessary adjustments. Investment and working capital cash flows are not adjusted because these cash flows do not affect taxable income. Revenue cash inflows and expense cash outflows are adjusted by multiplying the cash flow by (1 – tax rate). Although depreciation expense is not a cash outflow, it provides tax savings. The tax savings is calculated by multiplying depreciation expense by the tax rate. Once these adjustments are made, we can calculate the NPV and IRR.</li>
