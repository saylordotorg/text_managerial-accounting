    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch05_p01">Eric Mendez is the chief financial officer (CFO) of Bikes Unlimited, a company that produces mountain bikes and sells them to retail bicycle stores. Bikes Unlimited obtains the bulk of its parts from outside suppliers and assembles them into the mountain bikes prior to shipment. Last month (June), Bikes Unlimited sold 5,000 mountain bikes for $100 each. Last month’s income statement shows total revenue of $500,000 and operating profit of $50,000:</p>

    <p class="para block"> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch05_s01_p02">Answer: The three basic cost behavior patterns are known as variable, fixed, and mixed. Each of these cost patterns is described next.</p>
    <div class="section" id="heisinger_1.0-ch05_s01_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Variable Costs</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch05_s01_s01_p01"><em class="emphasis">Question: We know that some costs vary with changes in activity. </em><em class="emphasis bolditalic">What do we call this type of cost behavior?</em></p>
        <p class="para block"> </p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch05_s01_s01_p02">Answer: This cost behavior pattern is called a variable cost. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">variable cost</a><span class="glossdef">A cost that varies in total with changes in activity and remains constant on a per unit basis with changes in activity.</span></span> describes a cost that <em class="emphasis">varies in total</em> with changes in volume of activity. The activity in this example is the number of bikes produced and sold. However, the activity can take many different forms depending on the organization. The two most common variable costs are direct materials and direct labor. Other examples include indirect materials and energy costs.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch05_s01_s01_p03">Assume the cost of direct materials (wheels, seats, frames, and so forth) for each bike at Bikes Unlimited is $40. If Bikes Unlimited produces one bike, <em class="emphasis">total</em> variable cost for direct materials amounts to $40. If Bikes Unlimited doubles its production to two bikes, total variable cost for direct materials also doubles to $80. Variable costs typically change in proportion to changes in volume of activity. If volume of activity doubles, total variable costs also double, while the cost per unit remains the same. It is important to note that the term <em class="emphasis">variable</em> refers to what happens to <em class="emphasis">total costs</em> with changes in activity, not to the cost per unit.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch05_s01_s01_p04">Taking it one step further for Bikes Unlimited, let’s consider all variable costs related to production. Assume direct materials, direct labor, and all other variable production costs amount to $60 per unit. <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch05_s01_s01_t01">Table 5.1 "Variable Cost Behavior for Bikes Unlimited"</a> provides the total and per unit variable costs at three different levels of production, and <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch05_s01_s01_f01">Figure 5.1 "Total Variable Production Costs for Bikes Unlimited"</a> graphs the relation of total variable costs (<em class="emphasis">y</em>-axis) to units produced (<em class="emphasis">x</em>-axis). Note that the slope of the line represents the variable cost per unit of $60 (slope = change in variable cost ÷ change in units produced).</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch05_s01_s01_s01_p02">Answer: The type of activity used to estimate variable costs depends on the cost. For example, a law firm might use the <em class="emphasis">number of labor hours</em> to estimate labor costs. An airline such as <strong class="emphasis bold">American Airlines</strong> might use <em class="emphasis">hours of flying time</em> to estimate fuel costs.

        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_p02">Answer: This cost behavior pattern is called a fixed cost. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">fixed cost</a><span class="glossdef">A cost that remains constant in total with changes in activity and varies on a per unit basis with changes in activity.</span></span> describes a cost that is <em class="emphasis">fixed (does not change) in total</em> with changes in volume of activity. Assuming the activity is the number of bikes produced and sold, examples of fixed costs include salaried personnel, building rent, and insurance.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_p03">Assume Bikes Unlimited pays $8,000 per month in rent for its production facility. In addition, insurance for the same building is $2,000 per month and salaried production personnel are paid $6,000 per month. All other fixed production costs total $4,000. Thus Bikes Unlimited has total fixed costs of $20,000 per month related to its production facility (= $8,000 + $2,000 + $6,000 + $4,000). If only one bike is produced, Bikes Unlimited still must pay $20,000 per month. If 5,000 bikes are produced, Bikes Unlimited still pays $20,000 per month. The fixed costs remain unchanged in total as the level of activity changes.</p>

If Bikes Unlimited produces two bikes, the fixed cost per unit would be $10,000 (= $20,000 ÷ 2 bikes). As activity increases, the fixed costs are spread out over more units, which results in a lower cost per unit.</p>

For example, assume Bikes Unlimited has a five-year lease on the company’s production facility, which costs $8,000 per month. This is a committed fixed cost because the lease cannot easily be broken, and the company is committed to using this facility for years to come. Other examples of committed fixed costs include salaried employees with long-term contracts, depreciation on buildings, and insurance.</p>

For example, assume Bikes Unlimited contributes $10,000 each year toward charitable organizations. Management has the option of changing this amount in the short run without causing a significant impact on the organization. Other examples of discretionary fixed costs include advertising, research and development, and training programs (although an argument can be made that reducing these expenditures could have a significant impact on the company depending on the amount of the cuts).</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_s01_p04">In general, management looks to cut discretionary fixed costs when sales and profits are declining, since cuts in this area tend not to have as significant an impact on the organization as cutting committed fixed costs. Difficulties arise when struggling organizations go beyond cutting discretionary fixed costs and begin looking at cutting committed fixed costs.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch05_s01_s04_s01_p02">Answer: Variable, fixed, and mixed cost concepts are useful for short-term decision making and therefore apply to a specific period of time. This short-term period will vary depending on the company’s current production capacity and the time required to change capacity. In the long term, all cost behavior patterns will likely change.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch05_s01_s04_s01_p03">For example, suppose Bikes Unlimited’s production capacity is 8,000 units per month, and management plans to expand capacity in two years by renting a new production facility and hiring additional personnel. This is a long-term decision that will change the cost behavior patterns identified earlier. Variable production costs will no longer be $60 per unit, fixed production costs will no longer be $20,000 per month, and mixed sales compensation costs will also change. All these costs will change because the estimates are accurate only in the short term.</p>

The variable, fixed, and mixed costs identified for Bikes Unlimited will only be accurate within a certain range of activity. Once the firm goes outside that range, cost estimates are not necessarily accurate and often must be reevaluated and recalculated.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch05_s01_s04_s02_p03">For example, assume Bikes Unlimited’s mixed sales compensation costs of $10,000 per month plus $7 per unit is only valid up to 4,000 units per month. If unit sales increase beyond 4,000 units, management will hire additional salespeople and the total monthly base salary will increase beyond $10,000. Thus the relevant range for this mixed cost is from zero to 4,000 units. Once the company exceeds sales of 4,000 units per month, it is out of the relevant range, and the mixed cost must be recalculated.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch05_s01_s04_s02_p04">We discuss the relevant range concept in more detail later in the chapter. For now, remember that the accuracy of cost behavior patterns is limited to a certain range of activity called the relevant range.</p>

To reduce costs, the school district’s administration decided to consider closing one of the smaller elementary schools in the district. According to an initial estimate, closing this school would reduce costs by $500,000 to $1,000,000 per year. However, further analysis identified only $100,000 to $150,000 in cost savings.</p>
                <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch05_s01_s04_s03_p05">Why did the analysis yield lower savings than the initial estimate? Most of the costs were committed fixed costs (e.g., teachers’ salaries and benefits) and could not be eliminated in the short term. In fact, teachers and students at the school being considered for closure were to be moved to other schools in the district, and so no savings on teachers’ salaries and benefits would result. The only real short-term cost savings would be in not having to maintain the classrooms, computer lab, and library (nonunion employees would be let go) and in utilities (heat and air conditioning would be turned off).</p>

The company expects to increase sales by 10 to 20 percent, and Susan has been asked to estimate profit for August given this expected increase. Although examples of variable and fixed costs were provided in the previous sections, companies typically do not know exactly how much of their costs are fixed and how much are variable. (Financial accounting systems do not normally sort costs as fixed or variable.) Thus organizations must estimate their fixed and variable costs. </em><em class="emphasis bolditalic">What methods do organizations use to estimate fixed and variable costs?</em></p>
    <p class="para block"> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch05_s02_p02">Answer: Four common approaches are used to estimate fixed and variable costs:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch05_s02_l02">
        <li>Account analysis</li>
        <li>High-low method</li>

    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch05_s02_p03">All four methods are described next. The goal of each cost estimation method is to estimate fixed and variable costs and to describe this estimate in the form of Y = <em class="emphasis">f</em> + <em class="emphasis">v</em>X. That is, Total mixed cost = Total fixed cost + (Unit variable cost × Number of units). Note that the estimates presented next for Bikes Unlimited may differ from the dollar amounts used previously, which were for illustrative purposes only.</p>

        <p class="para block"> </p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch05_s02_s01_p02">Answer: This approach requires that an experienced employee or group of employees review the appropriate accounts and determine whether the costs in each account are fixed or variable. Totaling all costs identified as fixed provides the estimate of total fixed costs. To determine the variable cost per unit, all costs identified as variable are totaled and divided by the measure of activity (<em class="emphasis">units produced</em> is the measure of activity for Bikes Unlimited).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch05_s02_s01_p03">Let’s look at the account analysis approach using Bikes Unlimited as an example. Susan (the cost accountant) asked the financial accounting department to provide cost information for the production department for the month of June (July information is not yet available). Because the financial accounting department tracks information by department, it is able to produce this information. The production department information for June is as follows:</p>
        <div class="informalfigure large block">
            <img src="section_09/2062c2e62fe9dae85e98d0f387f36f16.jpg">
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch05_s02_s01_p04">Susan reviewed this cost information with the production manager, Indira Bingham, who has worked as production manager at Bikes Unlimited for several years. After careful review, Indira and Susan came up with the following breakdown of variable and fixed costs for June:</p>
        <div class="informalfigure large block">
            <img src="section_09/0b090fe855c80b577336558e8d78f851.jpg">
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch05_s02_s01_p05">Total fixed cost is estimated to be $30,000, and variable cost per unit is estimated to be $52 (= $260,000 ÷ 5,000 units produced). <em class="emphasis">Remember, the goal is to describe the mixed costs in the equation form Y = f + vX.</em> Thus the mixed cost equation used to estimate future production costs is</p>
        <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">Y = $30,000 + $52X</span></span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch05_s02_s01_p06">Now Susan can estimate monthly production costs (Y) if she knows how many units Bikes Unlimited plans to produce (X). For example, if Bikes Unlimited plans to produce 6,000 units for a particular month (a 20 percent increase over June) and this level of activity is within the relevant range, total production costs should be approximately $342,000 [= $30,000 + ($52 × 6,000 units)].</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch05_s02_s01_p08">Answer: June may not be a typical month for Bikes Unlimited. For example, utility costs may be low relative to those in the winter months, and production costs may be relatively high as the company prepares for increased demand in July and August. This might result in a lower materials cost per unit from quantity discounts offered by suppliers. To smooth out these fluctuations, companies often use data from the past quarter or past year to estimate costs.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch05_s02_s02_p23">For example, the $380,000 in production costs incurred in April may be higher than normal because several production machines broke down resulting in costly repairs. Or perhaps several key employees left the company, resulting in higher than normal labor costs for the month because the remaining employees were paid overtime. Cost accountants will often throw out the high and low points for this reason and use the next highest and lowest points to perform this analysis. While the high-low method is most often used as a quick and easy way to estimate fixed and variable costs, other more sophisticated methods are most often used to refine the estimates developed from the high-low method.</p>

                <li>This approach only considers the high and low activity levels in establishing an estimate of fixed and variable costs. The high and low data points may not represent the data set as a whole, and using these points can result in distorted estimates. In reviewing the set of data points for January through December, it appears that October and November are relatively extreme points when compared to the other 10 months. Because the cost equation is based solely on these two points, the resulting estimate of production costs for 400 units of production (in part 2) may not be accurate.</li>

Since variable costs are zero when no units are produced, the costs reflected on the graph at the <em class="emphasis">y</em>-intercept must represent total fixed costs. The graph in <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch05_s02_s03_f02">Figure 5.6 "Estimated Total Mixed Production Costs for Bikes Unlimited: Scattergraph Method"</a> indicates total fixed costs of approximately $45,000.

        <p class="para block"> </p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch05_s02_s03_p23">Answer: The scattergraph method mitigates this weakness by considering all data points in estimating fixed and variable costs. The scattergraph method gives us an opportunity to review all data points in the data set when we plot these data points in a graph in step 1. If certain data points seem unusual (statistics books often call these points <em class="emphasis">outliers</em>), we can exclude them from the data set when drawing the best-fitting line. In fact, many organizations use a scattergraph to identify outliers and then use <em class="emphasis">regression analysis</em> to estimate the cost equation Y = <em class="emphasis">f</em> + <em class="emphasis">v</em>X. We discuss regression analysis in the next section.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch05_s02_s03_p24">Although the scattergraph method tends to yield more accurate results than the high-low method, the final cost equation is still based on estimates. The line is drawn using our best judgment and a bit of guesswork, and the resulting <em class="emphasis">y</em>-intercept (fixed cost estimate) is based on this line. This approach is not an exact science! However, the next approach to estimating fixed and variable costs—regression analysis—uses mathematical equations to find the best-fitting line.</p>

        <p class="para block"> </p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch05_s02_s05_p08">Answer: Regression analysis tends to be most accurate because it provides a cost equation that best fits the line to the data points. However, the goal of most companies is to get close—the results do not need to be perfect. Some could reasonably argue that the account analysis approach is best because it relies on the knowledge of those who are familiar with the costs involved.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch05_s02_s05_p09">At Bikes Unlimited, Eric (CFO) and Susan (cost accountant) met several days later. After consulting with her staff, Susan agreed that regression analysis was the best approach to use in estimating total production costs (keep in mind nothing has been done yet with selling and administrative expenses). Account analysis was ruled out because no one on the accounting staff had been with the company long enough to review the accounts and determine which costs were variable, fixed, or mixed. The high-low method was ruled out because it only uses two data points and Eric would prefer a more accurate estimate. Susan did request that her staff prepare a scattergraph and review it for any unusual data points before performing regression analysis. Based on the scattergraph prepared, all agreed that the data was relatively uniform and no outlying data points were identified.</p>

                <li>The high-low method starts with the highest and lowest activity levels and uses four steps to estimate fixed and variable costs.</li>
                <li>The scattergraph method has five steps and starts with plotting all points on a graph and fitting a line through the points. This line represents costs throughout a range of activity levels and is used to estimate fixed and variable costs. The scattergraph is also used to identify any outlying or unusual data points.</li>
                <li>Regression analysis forms a mathematically determined line that best fits the data points. Software packages like Excel are available to perform regression analysis. As with the account analysis, high-low, and scattergraph methods, this line is described in the equation form Y = <em class="emphasis">f</em> + <em class="emphasis">v</em>X. This equation is used to estimate future costs.</li>
                <li>Four methods can be used to estimate fixed and variable costs. Each method has its advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of a method will depend on the situation at hand. Experienced employees may be able to effectively estimate fixed and variable costs by using the account analysis approach. If a quick estimate is needed, the high-low method may be appropriate. The scattergraph method helps with identifying any unusual data points, which can be thrown out when estimating costs. Finally, regression analysis can be run using computer software such as Excel and generally provides for more accurate cost estimates.</li>

    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch05_s03_p02"><em class="emphasis">Question: The challenge now is to organize this information in a way that is helpful to management—specifically, to Eric Mendez. The traditional income statement format used for external financial reporting simply breaks costs down by functional area: cost of goods sold and selling and administrative costs. It does not show fixed and variable costs. Panel A of <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch05_s03_f01">Figure 5.7 "Traditional and Contribution Margin Income Statements for Bikes Unlimited"</a> illustrates the traditional format. (We defer consideration of income taxes to the end of <a class="xref" href="heisinger_1.0-ch06#heisinger_1.0-ch06">Chapter 6 "How Is Cost-Volume-Profit Analysis Used for Decision Making?"</a>.) </em><em class="emphasis bolditalic">How can this information be presented in an income statement that shows fixed and variable costs separately?</em></p>
    <p class="para block"> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch05_s03_p03">Answer: Another income statement format, called the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">contribution margin income statement</a><span class="glossdef">An income statement used for internal reporting that shows fixed and variable cost information.</span></span>, shows the fixed and variable components of cost information. This type of statement appears in panel B of <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch05_s03_f01">Figure 5.7 "Traditional and Contribution Margin Income Statements for Bikes Unlimited"</a>. Note that operating profit is the same in both statements, but the organization of data differs. The contribution margin income statement organizes the data in a way that makes it easier for management to assess how changes in production and sales will affect operating profit. The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">contribution margin</a><span class="glossdef">Sales revenue left over after deducting variable costs from sales.</span></span> represents sales revenue left over after deducting variable costs from sales. It is the amount remaining that will <em class="emphasis">contribute</em> to covering fixed costs and to operating profit (hence, the name <em class="emphasis">contribution margin</em>).</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch05_s03_p04">Eric indicated that sales volume in August could increase by 20 percent over sales in June of 5,000 units, which would increase unit sales to 6,000 units [= 5,000 units + (5,000 × 20 percent)], and he asked Susan to come up with projected profit for August. Eric also mentioned that the sales price would remain the same at $100 per unit. Using this information and the cost estimate equations in <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch05_s03_t01">Table 5.5 "Cost Equations for Bikes Unlimited"</a>, Susan prepared the contribution margin income statement in panel B of <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch05_s03_f01">Figure 5.7 "Traditional and Contribution Margin Income Statements for Bikes Unlimited"</a>. Assume for now that 6,000 units is just within the relevant range for Bikes Unlimited. (We will discuss this assumption later in the chapter.)</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch05_s03_p05">The contribution margin income statement shown in panel B of <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch05_s03_f01">Figure 5.7 "Traditional and Contribution Margin Income Statements for Bikes Unlimited"</a> clearly indicates which costs are variable and which are fixed. Recall that the variable cost <em class="emphasis">per unit</em> remains constant, and variable costs <em class="emphasis">in total</em> change in proportion to changes in activity. Because 6,000 units are expected to be sold in August, total variable costs are calculated by multiplying 6,000 units by the cost per unit ($53.42 per unit for cost of goods sold, and $9.00 per unit for selling and administrative costs). Thus total <em class="emphasis">variable</em> cost of goods sold is $320,520, and total <em class="emphasis">variable</em> selling and administrative costs are $54,000. These two amounts are combined to calculate total variable costs of $374,520, as shown in panel B of <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch05_s03_f01">Figure 5.7 "Traditional and Contribution Margin Income Statements for Bikes Unlimited"</a>.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch05_s03_p06">The contribution margin of $225,480 represents the sales revenue left over after deducting variable costs from sales ($225,480 = $600,000 − $374,520). It is the amount remaining that will <em class="emphasis">contribute</em> to covering fixed costs and to operating profit.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch05_s03_p07">Recall that total fixed costs remain constant regardless of the level of activity. Thus <em class="emphasis">fixed</em> cost of goods sold remains at $43,276, and <em class="emphasis">fixed</em> selling and administrative costs stay at $110,000. This holds true at both the 5,000 unit level of activity for June, and the 6,000 unit level of activity projected for August. Total fixed costs of $153,276 (= $43,276 + $110,000) are deducted from the contribution margin to calculate operating profit of $72,204.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch05_s04_p01"><em class="emphasis">Question: Bikes Unlimited is making an important assumption in estimating fixed and variable costs. </em><em class="emphasis bolditalic">What is this important assumption and why might it be misleading?</em></p>
    <p class="para block"> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch05_s04_p02">Answer: The assumption is that total fixed costs and per unit variable costs will always be at the levels shown in <a class="xref" href="heisinger_1.0-ch05_s03#heisinger_1.0-ch05_s03_t01">Table 5.5 "Cost Equations for Bikes Unlimited"</a> regardless of the level of production. This will not necessarily hold true under all circumstances.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch05_s04_p03">For example, let’s say Bikes Unlimited picks up a large contract with a customer that requires producing an additional 30,000 units per month. Do you think the cost equations in <a class="xref" href="heisinger_1.0-ch05_s03#heisinger_1.0-ch05_s03_t01">Table 5.5 "Cost Equations for Bikes Unlimited"</a> would lead to accurate cost estimates? Probably not, because additional fixed costs would be incurred for facilities, salaried personnel, and other areas. Variable cost per unit would likely change also since additional direct labor would be required (either through overtime, which requires overtime pay, or by hiring more employees who are less efficient as they learn the process), and the volume of parts purchased from suppliers would increase, perhaps leading to reductions in per unit costs due to volume discounts for the parts.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch05_s04_p04">As defined earlier, the relevant range is a term used to describe the range of activity (units of production in this example) for which cost behavior patterns are likely to be accurate. Because the historical data used to create these equations for Bikes Unlimited ranges from a low of 2,900 units in January to a high of 5,900 units in April (see <a class="xref" href="heisinger_1.0-ch05_s02#heisinger_1.0-ch05_s02_s02_t01">Table 5.4 "Monthly Production Costs for Bikes Unlimited"</a>), management would investigate costs further when production levels fall outside of this range. The relevant range for total production costs at Bikes Unlimited is shown in <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch05_s04_f01">Figure 5.8 "Relevant Range for Total Production Costs at Bikes Unlimited"</a>. It is up to the cost accountant to determine the relevant range and make clear to management that estimates being made for activity outside of the relevant range must be analyzed carefully for accuracy.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch05_s04_p05">Recall that Bikes Unlimited estimated costs based on projected sales of 6,000 units for the month of August. Although this is slightly higher than the highest sales of 5,900 units in April, Susan (cost accountant) determined that Bikes Unlimited had the production capacity to produce 6,000 units without significantly affecting total fixed costs or per unit variable costs. Thus she determined that a sales level of 6,000 units was still within the relevant range. However, Susan also made Eric (CFO) aware that Bikes Unlimited was quickly approaching full capacity. If sales were expected to increase in the future, the company would have to increase capacity, and cost estimates would have to be revised.</p>
    <p class="para block"> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch05_s04_p06"><em class="emphasis">Question: Another important assumption being made by Bikes Unlimited is that all costs behave in a linear manner. Variable, fixed, and mixed costs are all described and shown as a straight line. However, many costs are not linear and often take on a nonlinear pattern. </em><em class="emphasis bolditalic">Why do some costs behave in a nonlinear way?</em></p>
    <p class="para block"> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch05_s04_p07">Answer: Assume the pattern shown in <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch05_s04_f02">Figure 5.9 "Nonlinear Variable Costs"</a> is for total variable production costs. Consider this: Have you ever worked a job where you were very slow at first but improved rapidly with experience? If a company produces just a few units each month, workers (direct labor) do not gain the experience needed to work efficiently and may waste time and materials. This has the effect of driving up the per unit variable cost. Recall that the slope of the line represents the unit cost; thus, when the unit cost increases, so does the slope. If the company produces more units each month, workers gain experience resulting in improved efficiency, and the per unit cost decreases (both in materials and labor). This causes the total cost line to flatten out a bit as the slope decreases. This is fine until the company starts to reach its limit in how much it can produce (called <em class="emphasis">capacity</em>). Now the company must hire additional inexperienced employees or pay its current employees overtime, which once again drives up the cost per unit. Thus the slope begins to increase.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch05_s04_p08">Although this is probably a more accurate description of how variable costs actually behave for most companies, it is much simpler to describe and estimate costs if you assume they are linear. As long as the relevant range is clearly identified, most companies can reasonably use the linearity assumption to estimate costs.</p>
