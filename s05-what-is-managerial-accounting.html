    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s01_p01"><em class="emphasis">Question: The issue facing the president at Sportswear is a common one. Companies prefer not to disclose more information than is required by U.S. GAAP, but they would like to have more detailed information for internal decision-making and performance-evaluation purposes. This is why it is important to distinguish between financial and managerial accounting. </em><em class="emphasis bolditalic">What is the difference between information prepared by financial accountants and information prepared by managerial accountants?</em></p>
    <p class="para block"> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s01_p02">Answer: <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Financial accounting</a><span class="glossdef">Provides historical financial information to external users.</span></span> focuses on providing historical financial information to external users. External users are those outside the company, including owners (e.g., shareholders) and creditors (e.g., banks or bondholders). Financial accountants reporting to external users are required to follow <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (U.S. GAAP)</a><span class="glossdef">A set of accounting rules that must be followed to provide consistency in reporting financial information to external users.</span></span>, a set of accounting rules that requires consistency in recording and reporting financial information. This information typically summarizes overall company results and does not provide detailed information.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s01_p03"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Managerial accounting</a><span class="glossdef">Focuses on internal users, including executives, product managers, sales managers, and any other personnel in the organization who use accounting information for decision making.</span></span> focuses on internal users—executives, product managers, sales managers, and any other personnel within the organization who use accounting information to make important decisions. Managerial accounting information need not conform with U.S. GAAP. In fact, conformance with U.S. GAAP may be a deterrent to getting useful information for internal decision-making purposes. For example, when establishing an inventory cost for one or more units of product (each jersey or hat produced at Sportswear Company), U.S. GAAP requires that production overhead costs, such as factory rent and factory utility costs, be included. However, for internal decision-making purposes, it might make more sense to include nonproduction costs that are directly linked to the product, such as sales commissions or administrative costs.</p>
    <p class="para block"> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s01_p04"><em class="emphasis">Question: It’s clear that financial accounting focuses on reporting to outside users while managerial accounting focuses on reporting to inside users. </em><em class="emphasis bolditalic">What specific characteristics would we expect to see in managerial accounting information?</em></p>
    <p class="para block"> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s01_p05">Answer: Managerial accounting often focuses on making future projections for segments of a company. Suppose Sportswear Company is considering introducing a new line of coffee mugs with team logos on each mug. Management would certainly need detailed financial projections for sales, costs, and the resulting profits (or losses). Although historical financial accounting data from other product lines would be useful, preparing projections for the new line of mugs would be a managerial accounting function.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s01_p06">Another characteristic of managerial accounting data is its high level of detail. As noted in the opening dialogue between the president and accountant at Sportswear Company, the financial information in the annual report provides a general overview of the company’s financial results but does not provide any detailed information about each product. Information, such as product profitability, would come from the managerial accounting function.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s01_p07">Finally, managerial accounting information often takes the form of nonfinancial measures. For example, Sportswear Company might measure the percentage of defective products produced or the percentage of on-time deliveries to customers. This kind of nonfinancial information comes from the managerial accounting function.</p>

        <p class="para block"> </p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s01_s01_p02">Answer: The president at Sportswear, Dana Matthews, learned that the hats product line was much more profitable than expected, accounting for 55 percent of the company’s profits even though initial estimates were that the hat segment would account for 40 percent of company profits. Conversely, the jerseys product line was much less profitable than expected, accounting for 45 percent of the company’s profits.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s01_s01_p03">There are many issues associated with determining product profitability, including how to allocate costs that are not easily traced to each product and whether the product revenue and cost information is accurate enough to make important managerial decisions.

        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s02_s02_p02">Answer: The control function evaluates whether an organization’s plans were implemented effectively and often leads to recommendations for the future. Many organizations compare actual results with the initial plan (or budget) to evaluate performance of employees, departments, or the entire organization.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s02_s02_p03">For example, assume <strong class="emphasis bold">Ernst &amp; Young</strong> creates a budget indicating the labor hours needed to perform tax services for a particular client (this is the <em class="emphasis">planning</em> function). After the work is performed, actual labor hours used to complete the work are compared to budgeted labor hours. This analysis is then used to evaluate whether employees were able to complete the work within the budgeted time and often results in recommendations for the future. Recommendations might include the need for adding more labor hours to the budget or obtaining better support documents from the client.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s03_p02">Answer: Let’s look at an example to answer this question. Suppose you are the president of Sportswear Company, mentioned earlier in the chapter, which produces hats and jerseys for fans of professional sports teams. Assume this is a large public company. (The term <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">public company</a><span class="glossdef">A company whose shares of stock are publicly traded.</span></span> refers to a company whose shares of stock are publicly traded—that is, the general investing public can purchase and sell ownership in the company.) As president of Sportswear, you ask the following questions:</p>
    <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s03_l02" numeration="arabic">
        <li>How much will we owe the government in income taxes for the year?</li>
        <li>What was total net income for the last fiscal year?</li>
        <li>Should we expand into new geographic markets?</li>
        <li>If we do decide to expand into new markets, should we obtain financing by issuing bonds, obtaining a loan from a bank, or issuing common stock?</li>
        <li>How profitable is each segment of our business (hats and jerseys)?</li>

Instead of employing its own internal auditor, an organization might hire one from an outside consulting firm. Some organizations may not have a CFO, or they may have a CFO but not a controller.

        <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s04_p08">The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed three actions against <strong class="emphasis bold">Diebold, Inc.</strong>, a manufacturer and seller of automated teller machines, for improperly inflating earnings over a five-year period. Three former employees—the CFO, controller, and director of accounting—were accused of improperly inflating revenue on factory orders, improperly recognizing revenue on a lease transaction, manipulating reserves and accruals, improperly capitalizing expenses, and improperly increasing the value of inventory. These actions allegedly resulted in over 40 misstated annual, quarterly, and other reports filed with the SEC, along with numerous inaccurate press releases.</p>
        <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s04_p09">The company agreed to pay a $25,000,000 civil penalty, and the three former employees remain in litigation.

                <p class="para">Several options exist for resolving ethical conflicts. The IMA suggests the following courses of action:</p>
                <ul class="itemizedlist" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s04_l07">
                    <li>Follow the policies of the organization involving the resolution of ethical conflicts.</li>
                    <li>If following the organization’s policies does not effectively resolve the conflict, discuss the problem with your immediate supervisor unless the supervisor is involved.</li>
                    <li>If the immediate superior cannot reach a satisfactory resolution, the problem should be presented to the next higher managerial level.</li>
                    <li>If all higher levels of management do not reach a satisfactory resolution, an acceptable reviewing authority may be a group, such as the audit committee, executive committee, board of directors, board of trustees, or owners.</li>
                    <li>Another option includes consulting an objective advisor (e.g., IMA ethics counseling service or an attorney).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Several options are available. The IMA suggests first following the organization’s policies with regard to resolving ethical conflicts. If Drive Write does not have policies in place or if following the organization’s policies does not resolve the conflict, the next step is to discuss the conflict with the immediate supervisor. However, the president of Drive Write (the immediate supervisor) is involved in the conflict, so approaching the president’s superiors would be best. This could be the audit committee, executive committee, board of directors, or owners. If after pursuing these different courses of action the ethical conflict still exists, it may be appropriate to consult an objective advisor (e.g., the IMA helpline) and perhaps consult an attorney as to legal obligations and rights concerning the ethical conflict. (Many would argue that regardless of the outcome, one would not want to work for a company where this type of unethical behavior occurs at the top, or anywhere within the organization, and that resigning is the best course of action.)</li>

    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s05_p01"><em class="emphasis">Question: Many companies today are growing out of their accounting systems. In the old days, accounting systems were designed primarily to track daily transactions and provide reports to external users on a monthly, quarterly, or annual basis. But times have changed, and companies now need more information internally to make good decisions. Accounting systems are currently used for both external reporting (financial accounting) and internal reporting (managerial accounting). Even relatively small accounting packages, such as QuickBooks and Peachtree, provide features that are important for managerial accounting. However, most agree that no single accounting system will meet the needs of every organization and that two important factors must be considered when choosing a system. </em><em class="emphasis bolditalic">What are the two factors that must be considered when deciding on an accounting system?</em></p>
    <p class="para block"> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s05_p02">Answer: The two factors are (1) the size of the organization and (2) the information needs of the organization. Each factor is discussed next.</p>
    <div class="section" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s05_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">How Big Is Your Company?</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s05_s01_p01">Accounting software is designed to serve different-sized companies. The size of a company is commonly measured in sales revenue. Experts express varying opinions on what constitutes a small, midsized, or large company. Some believe that small companies have sales up to $10,000,000, midsized companies have sales up to $100,000,000, and large companies have sales greater than $100,000,000. Others prefer different amounts. Regardless of the number used, the goal is to find an accounting system that best meets the needs of the organization, and the size of the organization plays a big part in finding the best-fitting system.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s05_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">What Information Is Needed?</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s05_s02_p01">Before selecting an accounting system, an organization must determine its accounting needs. Some organizations simply need the equivalent of a check register, which provides easy tracking of expense codes as checks are issued and makes bank reconciliations a snap. Other organizations require more than a check register; they may demand a system that can create invoices, process payroll, and track inventory. More complex organizations will want the ability to perform more advanced functions. Such organizations might need to customize reports (e.g., create an income statement by division or customer), modify input screens, send financial reports via e-mail, export reports to spreadsheet software such as Excel, and create reports with graphics (e.g., tables, pie charts, and line charts).</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s05_s03_p01"><em class="emphasis">Question: Clearly the size and information needs of a company will drive the selection of an accounting system for the company. As the need for accounting data has become more complex, accounting systems have been developed that perform a wide variety of tasks. These systems are called enterprise resource planning systems. </em><em class="emphasis bolditalic">What is an enterprise resource planning system, and how does this system help companies utilize accounting data?</em></p>
        <p class="para block"> </p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s05_s03_p02">Answer: <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Enterprise resource planning (ERP)</a><span class="glossdef">A system designed to record and share information across functional and geographical areas to meet the needs of internal and external users.</span></span> systems are designed to record and share information across functional areas (e.g., accounting, marketing, human resources, and shipping) and across geographical areas (e.g., from a sales office in California to headquarters in Hong Kong). ERP systems continually update information to provide real-time data to all users, and the data can be organized in different formats to meet the needs of internal and external users. For example, in his book <em class="emphasis">Onward</em>, Howard Schultz describes how as CEO of <strong class="emphasis bold">Starbucks</strong> he reviews comparative financial data for <strong class="emphasis bold">Starbucks</strong> stores daily. This information comes from the ERP system at <strong class="emphasis bold">Starbucks</strong>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s05_s03_p03">The idea behind ERP software, and a central theme in managerial accounting, is that accurate and up-to-date financial information will help organizations make better decisions. Better decisions typically lead to improvements in profitability, efficiency, and customer satisfaction.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s05_s03_p04">ERP systems are expensive. Annual costs for large organizations can easily exceed $10,000,000. However, smaller systems for midsized companies are available at a much lower cost. Most ERP software is offered in modules for functional accounting areas, such as accounts receivable, accounts payable, payroll, inventory, and job costing. The more modules included, the higher the cost will be. Popular makers of ERP systems include <strong class="emphasis bold">Microsoft</strong>, <strong class="emphasis bold">Oracle</strong>, and <strong class="emphasis bold">SAP Corporation</strong>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s05_s03_p05">In deciding whether to upgrade to an ERP system, organizations must be sure that the benefits of using the data from a new system outweigh the costs of implementing the system. If management does not intend to use the information to improve planning and decision making, then going with a less sophisticated accounting system may be the better approach.</p>

        <p class="para block"> </p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s05_s04_p02">Answer: Since managers make extensive use of spreadsheets to organize and analyze data, most computerized accounting systems are designed to export data to spreadsheet software programs such as Excel. For example, <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch01_s05_s04_f01">Figure 1.3 "Excel Spreadsheet for Southwest Airlines"</a> shows how a spreadsheet was used to import data directly from <strong class="emphasis bold">Southwest Airlines’</strong> 2010 annual report. This allows the user to analyze the data more easily. Notice that in <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch01_s05_s04_f01">Figure 1.3 "Excel Spreadsheet for Southwest Airlines"</a> the total operating revenue increased over the three years shown. We could use Excel to quickly determine the exact percentage increase from 2008 to 2009 and from 2009 to 2010.</p>

        <p class="para block"> </p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s05_s04_p04">Answer: You could start by exporting this year’s results from the accounting system to an Excel spreadsheet. Then you could set up a new column to show estimates for next year. You would likely discuss different aspects of the income statement with various personnel in the organization—making changes as you go—before finalizing your projections.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s05_s04_p05">Imagine the work involved if you did not use a computer but instead had to write the information down by hand. If there were any changes to the information, you would have to make time-consuming calculations, and once the data were finalized, you would be faced with the manual preparation of formal reports. With the relatively recent advances in business technology, the days of preparing information manually are over. Most organizations require their accounting and finance personnel to have advanced computer spreadsheet skills. Our goal is to provide you with an opportunity to use spreadsheets in a way that mirrors the real world.</p>

The sales price of each table varies significantly, from $1,000 to more than $30,000. <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch01_s06_s01_f01">Figure 1.4 "Direct Materials, Direct Labor, and Manufacturing Overhead at Custom Furniture Company"</a> shows examples of production activities at Custom Furniture Company for each of the three categories (we continue using this company as an example in <a class="xref" href="heisinger_1.0-ch02#heisinger_1.0-ch02">Chapter 2 "How Is Job Costing Used to Track Production Costs?"</a>).</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s06_s02_s02_p03">Although selling costs and general and administrative costs are considered nonmanufacturing costs, managers often want to assign some of these costs to products for decision-making purposes. For example, sales commissions and shipping costs for a specific product could be assigned to the product. This does not comply with U.S. GAAP because, under U.S. GAAP, only product costs can be assigned to products. However, as we noted earlier, managerial accounting information is tailored to meet the needs of the users and need not follow U.S. GAAP.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s06_s02_s02_p04">Distinguishing between manufacturing and nonmanufacturing costs is not always simple. For example, if legal staff works on an issue associated with production personnel and if human resources staff hires assembly line workers, are the costs involved manufacturing or nonmanufacturing costs? It is up to each organization to determine how to handle such costs for product costing purposes. The advantage of managerial accounting over financial accounting is that costs can be organized in any manner that helps managers make decisions. However, in this chapter, to avoid ambiguity, we follow the definitions provided by U.S. GAAP.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s06_s03_p02">Answer: Distinguishing between the two categories is critical because the category determines where a cost will appear in the financial statements. All manufacturing costs (direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead) are attached to inventory as an asset on the balance sheet until the goods are sold, at which point the costs are transferred to cost of goods sold on the income statement as an expense.

Direct labor involves the employees who build the custom tables. Manufacturing overhead includes items such as indirect materials (glue, screws, nails, sandpaper, and stain), indirect labor (production supervisor), and other manufacturing costs, such as factory equipment maintenance and factory utilities. </em><em class="emphasis bolditalic">What accounts are used to record the costs associated with these items, and where do these accounts appear in the financial statements?</em></p>
    <p class="para block"> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s07_p02">Answer: All the costs mentioned previously for Custom Furniture are product costs (also called <em class="emphasis">manufacturing costs</em>). Product costs are recorded as an asset on the balance sheet until the products are sold, at which point the costs are recorded as an expense on the income statement. To record product costs as an asset, accountants use one of three inventory accounts: raw materials inventory, work-in-process inventory, or finished goods inventory. The account they use depends on the product’s level of completion. They use one expense account—cost of goods sold—to record the product costs when the goods are sold.</p>

Lastly, <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch01_s07_s02_n01">Note 1.57 "Business in Action 1.7"</a> provides an example of how the accounts shown in <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch01_s07_s02_t01">Table 1.4 "Accounts Used to Record Product Costs"</a> and <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch01_s07_s02_f01">Figure 1.6 "Flow of Product Costs through Balance Sheet and Income Statement Accounts"</a> appear in financial statements. Take time to review these items carefully. Your understanding of them will help clarify how product costs flow through the accounts and where product costs appear in the financial statements.

The accounting process and income statement for service companies are relatively simple. Merchandising companies (also called retail companies) like </em><em class="emphasis bolditalic">Macy’s </em><em class="emphasis">and </em><em class="emphasis bolditalic">Home Depot </em><em class="emphasis">buy and sell goods but typically do not manufacture goods. Since merchandising companies must account for the purchase and sale of goods, their accounting systems are more complex than those of service companies. Manufacturing companies, such as </em><em class="emphasis bolditalic">Johnson &amp; Johnson </em><em class="emphasis">and </em><em class="emphasis bolditalic">Honda Motor Company</em><em class="emphasis">, produce and sell goods. Such companies require an accounting system that goes well beyond accounting solely for the purchase and sale of goods. </em><em class="emphasis bolditalic">Why are accounting systems more complex for manufacturing companies?</em></p>
    <p class="para block"> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s08_p02">Answer: Accounting systems are more complex for manufacturing companies because they need a system that tracks manufacturing costs throughout the production process to the point at which goods are sold. Since income statements for manufacturing companies tend to be more complex than for service or merchandising companies, we devote this section to income statements for manufacturing companies. Understanding income statements in a manufacturing setting begins with the inventory cost flow equation.</p>

        <p class="para block"> </p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s08_s01_p02">Answer: We can use the basic cost flow equation to calculate unknown balances for just about any balance sheet account (e.g., cash, accounts receivable, and inventory). The equation is as follows:</p>
        <div class="callout block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s08_s01_n01">

        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s08_s01_p03">We will apply this equation to the three inventory asset accounts discussed earlier (raw materials, work in process, and finished goods) to calculate the cost of raw materials used in production, cost of goods manufactured, and cost of goods sold.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s08_s01_p04"><em class="emphasis">Raw materials used in production</em> shows the cost of direct and indirect materials placed into the production process. <em class="emphasis">Cost of goods manufactured</em> represents the cost of goods completed and transferred out of work-in-process (WIP) inventory into finished goods inventory. <em class="emphasis">Cost of goods sold</em> represents the cost of goods that are sold and transferred out of finished goods inventory into cost of goods sold.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s08_s01_p05">Accountants need all these amounts—raw materials placed in production, cost of goods manufactured, and cost of goods sold—to prepare an income statement for a manufacturing company.

As you review these schedules, note that each schedule provides information required for the next schedule, as indicated by the arrows. Remember the inventory cost flow equation is used for each schedule. This is why you see abbreviations for each element of the equation: beginning balance <em class="emphasis">(BB)</em>, transfers in <em class="emphasis">(TI)</em>, ending balance <em class="emphasis">(EB)</em>, and transfers out <em class="emphasis">(TO)</em>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s08_s01_p08">The goal of going through the process shown in <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch01_s08_s01_f01">Figure 1.7 "Income Statement Schedules for Custom Furniture Company"</a> is to arrive at a cost of goods sold amount, which is presented on the income statement.

As you review <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch01_s08_s01_f01">Figure 1.7 "Income Statement Schedules for Custom Furniture Company"</a> and <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch01_s08_s01_f02">Figure 1.8 "Income Statement for Custom Furniture Company"</a>, look back at <a class="xref" href="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s07#heisinger_1.0-ch01_s07_s02_f01">Figure 1.6 "Flow of Product Costs through Balance Sheet and Income Statement Accounts"</a> to see how costs flow through the three inventory accounts and the cost of goods sold account.</p>

At this point, your job is to understand how we use the inventory cost flow equation to calculate raw materials placed in production, cost of goods manufactured, and cost of goods sold. (Note: Companies using a perpetual inventory system do not necessarily prepare these formal schedules because perpetual systems update records immediately when inventory is transferred from one inventory account to another. However, these companies take a physical count periodically to ensure the accuracy of inventory accounts and use the cost flow equation and similar schedules to ensure their perpetual system balances are accurate. <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch01_s08_s01_n02">Note 1.62 "Business in Action 1.8"</a> shows how the cost flow equation can be used to analyze the effects of fraud that was allegedly committed at Rite Aid.)</p>

In 2002, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed accounting fraud charges against several former executives of <strong class="emphasis bold">Rite Aid</strong>.

            <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch01_s08_s01_p11">According to the complaint, <strong class="emphasis bold">Rite Aid</strong> executives committed financial fraud in several areas, one of which involved inventory. At the end of the company’s fiscal year, the physical inventory count showed $9,000,000 less than <strong class="emphasis bold">Rite Aid’s</strong> inventory balance on the books, presumably due to physical deterioration of the goods or theft. <strong class="emphasis bold">Rite Aid</strong> executives allegedly failed to record this shrinkage, thereby overstating ending inventory on the balance sheet and understating cost of goods sold on the income statement.</p>

Jorge is an accounting staff member who works for the company’s controller and is involved in preparing the annual report. One of High Tech’s competitors developed a superior color laser jet printer using a less costly production process. Jorge realizes that High Tech’s substantial inventory of color laser jet printers is effectively obsolete and will have to be written down to its net realizable value in accordance with U.S. GAAP. This means higher expenses and lower profits.</p>

One week before the end of the fiscal year, a customer decides to delay a significant purchase of equipment until March of the next year. As a result, Equipment Group’s profits will decrease by $2,000,000 to $198,000,000 for the year.</p>
