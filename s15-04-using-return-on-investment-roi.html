    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch11_s04_p03">Note that different organizations use different measures to calculate ROI. Our goal in this discussion is to introduce one common approach, but keep in mind that organizations often make adjustments to this formula to better suit their needs.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch11_s04_p04">The advantage of ROI as a performance measure is that it includes the use of assets. For example, assume 2 divisions have $10,000 in operating income. Both divisions appear to have performed equally well based on operating income. However, further review shows that Division 1 invested $200,000 in average operating assets to produce this income while Division 2 invested $400,000. Clearly, the division that invested half the amount in assets to produce the same amount of income had the best performance of the two. Comparing the ROI for each division proves this:</p>

Examples of operating assets include cash, accounts receivable, prepaid assets, buildings, and equipment. As long as the division uses the assets to produce operating income, they are included in the operating assets category. Examples of nonoperating assets—assets not included in this calculation—include land held for investment purposes and office buildings leased to other companies.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch11_s04_s01_p05">An average of operating assets is taken over the period being evaluated for two reasons. First, operating assets are often purchased and sold during an accounting period, and simply taking the ending balance might produce distorted, if not inaccurate, results. Second, operating income represents information for a period of time (income statements always present information for a <em class="emphasis">period of time</em>), while operating assets are presented at a point in time (balance sheets always present information for a <em class="emphasis">point in time</em>). If both of these items are to be included in one ratio (ROI), it is best to use average balance information for balance sheet items. In fact, if the information is readily available, it would be best to take an average of daily operating asset balances for the period being evaluated.</p>

The Sporting Goods division has the highest ROI at 11.23 percent, Board Games is second at 8.93 percent, and Computer Games is the lowest at 6.75 percent.

                <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch11_s04_s03_s02_s01_p01">In the Game Products, Inc., example, we use the net book value of long-term assets to calculate operating assets. That is, accumulated depreciation is subtracted from the original cost on the segmented balance sheet in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The balance sheet presented in <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch11_s04_s02_f01">Figure 11.4 "Segmented Balance Sheets (Game Products, Inc.)"</a> shows this in the line item labeled <em class="emphasis">property, plant, and equipment, net</em>. The advantage of using net book value is that the information is easily obtained from the financial records.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch11_s04_s03_s02_s01_p02">The problem with this approach is division managers with older assets that have been substantially depreciated have an advantage over division managers with newer assets that have not been significantly depreciated. Older assets have a lower net book value (cost – accumulated depreciation) than newer assets, which reduces average operating assets in the denominator and increases ROI.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch11_s04_s03_s02_s01_p03">For example, assume two divisions have identical operating income for the year and identical assets. However, Division 1 has been in operation for many more years than Division 2 and thus has far more accumulated depreciation on long-term assets. This results in a lower net book value on long-term assets for Division 1 as shown in the following:</p>
                <div class="informalfigure large block">

                <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch11_s04_s03_s02_s01_p04">Assuming all other assets are identical, and both divisions have identical operating income, Division 1 will have a higher ROI simply because long-term assets are older and have more accumulated depreciation, thereby reducing average operating assets in the denominator. (Reducing the denominator increases the ratio.)</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch11_s04_s03_s02_s01_p05">An additional weakness in using net book value to calculate average operating assets is the disincentive it creates for division managers to replace old and inefficient long-term assets, such as equipment and machinery. Although new equipment purchases may be needed to improve efficiency and to remain competitive, the short-term impact is to reduce ROI. (Older equipment will have a lower net book value than identical newer equipment. Thus replacing old equipment will decrease ROI.)</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch11_s04_s03_s02_s01_p06">If division managers are evaluated based on ROI, using net book value tends to discourage investments in long-term assets, often at the expense of the organization’s long-term profitability.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch11_s04_s03_s02_s02_p01">An alternative approach in calculating ROI is to use gross book value in the average operating assets calculation.
