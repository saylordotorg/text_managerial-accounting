    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch12_p01">John Huston, CEO and founder of Home Store, Inc., has reviewed the company’s income statement and balance sheet for the most recent fiscal year ended December 31, 2012. Home Store has grown rapidly this past year, with sales and net income showing significant gains compared to 2011. Although John is satisfied with the increase in profitability, he notices a significant decline in cash. John decides to pursue this with Linda Nash (CFO) and Steve Bauer (treasurer) in their weekly meeting:</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch12_p02">Home Store, Inc., has cash flow problems that are common to many fast growing companies. Although the income statement and balance sheet provide important information concerning financial performance and financial condition, neither statement provides information regarding cash activity for a period of time. The focus of this chapter is on preparing a statement that provides cash flow information. This statement is appropriately called the <em class="emphasis">statement of cash flows</em>.</p>

Financial accounting courses cover the first three statements in detail and often provide an overview of the statement of cash flows. This chapter will focus on preparing the statement of cash flows and on using the resulting cash flow information for analytical purposes. </em><em class="emphasis bolditalic">What information is provided in the statement of cash flows?</em></p>
    <p class="para block"> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch12_s01_p02">Answer: The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">statement of cash flows</a><span class="glossdef">A financial statement that provides cash receipt and cash payment information and explains the change in cash for a period of time.</span></span> provides cash receipt and cash payment information and reconciles the change in cash for a period of time. Cash receipts and cash payments are summarized and categorized as operating, investing, or financing activities. Simply put, the statement of cash flows indicates where cash came from and where cash went for a period of time.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch12_s01_p03">Assume you keep track of your individual cash transactions for an entire year in a check register (e.g., checks written and paycheck deposits) and suppose you have hundreds of transactions for the year. Rather than showing every single transaction in a formal report, the statement of cash flows summarizes these transactions. For example, all cash receipts from paychecks are added together and shown as one line item, all cash payments for rent are added together and shown as one line item, all cash payments for food are added together and shown as one line item, and so on. The goal is to start with the beginning of the year cash balance, add all cash receipts for the year, subtract all cash payments for the year, and find the resulting end-of-year cash balance. Although the formal statement of cash flows is not quite this simple, the concept is the same.</p>
    <p class="para block"> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch12_s01_p04"><em class="emphasis">Question: </em><em class="emphasis bolditalic">Why did the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) create the statement of cash flows in 1987?</em></p>
    <p class="para block"> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch12_s01_p05">Answer: The statement of cash flows was created due to a lack of cash flow information on the income statement, balance sheet, and statement of owners’ equity. The income statement shows revenues and expenses using the accrual basis of accounting, but it does not indicate how much cash was received for revenues or paid for expenses. The balance sheet shows assets, liabilities, and owners’ equity at a point in time, but it does not show how much cash was received or paid for these items. The only cash information provided on these statements is the change in cash from the end of last period to the end of the current period derived from the cash line item on the balance sheet (often called <em class="emphasis">cash and cash equivalents</em>).</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch12_s01_p06">Owners, creditors, and managers wanted more cash flow information. They often asked such questions as: Why did cash go down? How much cash was received related to net income? How much cash was paid for the purchase of equipment? How much cash was received from issuing bonds? As a result of the demand for more cash flow information, the FASB formally created the statement of cash flows in 1987 (Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 95, which can be found at <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.fasb.org">http://www.fasb.org</a>). Most companies are now required to prepare the statement of cash flows along with the other three statements. We begin the process of explaining how to prepare this statement in the next section.</p>

However, cash on the balance sheet only increased $147,000,000 for the same period. Why did total cash go up by such a small amount compared to the $1,600,000,000 increase in cash from operating activities? The statement of cash flows provides the information necessary to answer this question. <strong class="emphasis bold">Southwest</strong> spent $493,000,000 on property and equipment (planes, parts, etc.) and $155,000,000 to pay off long-term debt. <strong class="emphasis bold">Southwest</strong> also purchased $772,000,000 in short-term investments.</p>

            <li>The purpose of the statement of cash flows is to provide a summary of cash receipt and cash payment information for a period of time and to reconcile the difference between beginning and ending cash balances shown on the balance sheet.

            <li>The FASB created the statement of cash flows because owners, creditors, managers, and other stakeholders wanted more information regarding cash receipts and cash expenditures. Although the balance sheet shows cash balances at the end of each period, no further information is provided on the balance sheet, income statement, or statement of owners’ equity regarding cash flow activities. The statement of cash flows takes care of this problem.</li>

    <p class="para block"> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch12_s02_p05">Answer: The operating activities section of the statement of cash flows is generally regarded as the most important section since it provides cash flow information related to the daily operations of the business. This section answers the question, “how much cash did we generate from the daily activities of our core business?” Owners, creditors, and managers are most interested in cash flow generated from daily activities rather than from a one-time issuance of stock or a one-time sale of land. The operating activities section allows stakeholders to assess the ongoing viability of the company. We discuss how to use cash flow information to evaluate organizations later in the chapter.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch12_s04_s01_s01_p02">Answer: The first adjustment to net income involves adding back expenses that do not affect cash (often called noncash expenses). For example, the accrual basis of accounting deducts depreciation expense in calculating net income, even though depreciation expense does not involve cash. (Recall the financial accounting entry to record depreciation expense: debit depreciation expense and credit accumulated depreciation. Notice cash is not involved.) Thus to convert net income to a cash basis, depreciation expense is added back to net income. In effect, we are reversing depreciation expense because it is not an expense using the cash basis of accounting. The end result is as though depreciation expense was never deducted as an expense.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch12_s04_s01_s01_p03">Next, we show how the first adjustment to net income appears in the operating activities section of the statement of cash flows for Home Store, Inc.

            <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch12_s04_s01_s02_p02">Answer: The second adjustment to net income involves adding back losses and deducting gains related to investing activities. For example, Home Store, Inc., realized a $6,000 loss on the sale of equipment. This loss is shown on the income statement as a deduction in calculating net income (see <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch12_s04_f01">Figure 12.3 "Balance Sheet and Income Statement for Home Store, Inc."</a>). However, this loss is <em class="emphasis">not</em> related to the daily operations of the business. That is, Home Store, Inc., is not in the business of buying and selling equipment daily. Remember, we are trying to find the cash provided by <em class="emphasis">operating activities</em> in this section of the statement of cash flows.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch12_s04_s01_s02_p03">Since equipment is a <em class="emphasis">noncurrent</em> asset, cash activity related to the disposal of equipment should be included in the investment activities section of the statement of cash flows. Thus the $6,000 loss shown as a deduction on the income statement is added back to net income, and it will be included later in the investing activities section as part of the proceeds from the sale of equipment. In effect, we are reversing the $6,000 loss because it is <em class="emphasis">not</em> an operating expense.</p>

These changes are already shown in the far right column of the balance sheet portion of <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch12_s04_f01">Figure 12.3 "Balance Sheet and Income Statement for Home Store, Inc."</a>. Two important rules must be followed to determine how the change is reflected as an adjustment to net income. Study these two rules carefully:</p>
            <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch12_s04_s01_s03_l01" numeration="arabic">
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Current assets.</strong> Increases in current assets are <em class="emphasis">deducted</em> from net income; decreases in current assets are <em class="emphasis">added</em> to net income. (There is an <em class="emphasis">inverse relationship</em> between the change in a current asset account and how it is shown as an adjustment.)</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Current liabilities.</strong> Increases in current liabilities are <em class="emphasis">added</em> to net income; decreases in current liabilities are <em class="emphasis">deducted</em> from net income. (There is a <em class="emphasis">direct relationship</em> between the change in a current liability account and how it is shown as an adjustment.)</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch12_s04_s01_s03_p03">Now let’s work through each current asset and current liability line item shown in the balance sheet (<a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch12_s04_f01">Figure 12.3 "Balance Sheet and Income Statement for Home Store, Inc."</a>) and use these rules to determine how each item fits into the operating activities section as an adjustment to net income.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch12_s04_s01_s03_p04">The first current asset line item, cash, shows the change in cash from the beginning of the year to the end of year. Cash decreased by $98,000. The goal of the statement of cash flows is to show what caused this $98,000 decrease. This amount will appear in step 4 when we reconcile the beginning cash balance to the ending cash balance. The next line item is accounts receivable.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch12_s04_s01_s03_p05"><strong class="emphasis bold">Accounts receivable (current asset) increased by $60,000.</strong> The current asset rule states that increases in current assets are deducted from net income. Thus $60,000 is deducted from net income in the operating activities section of the statement of cash flows. Here’s why.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch12_s04_s01_s03_p06">Assume all Home Store’s sales shown on the income statement are credit sales (each sale required a debit to accounts receivable and a credit to sales). The beginning accounts receivable balance of $25,000 is increased by $900,000 for credit sales made during the year, resulting in $925,000 in total receivables to be collected. Since $85,000 in accounts receivable remains at the end of the year, $840,000 in cash was collected (= $925,000 − $85,000). On a cash basis, Home Store, Inc., should show $840,000 in revenue rather than $900,000. Thus net income must be reduced by $60,000 (= $900,000 revenue using accrual basis − $840,000 revenue using cash basis). The accounts receivable T-account shown in the following provides further clarification.</p>

To explain why, let’s assume Home Store, Inc., pays cash for all purchases of merchandise inventory. If the merchandise inventory account increases over time, more goods are purchased than are sold. Because merchandise inventory at Home Store, Inc., increased $66,000 and cost of goods sold totaled $546,000 (as shown in <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch12_s04_f01">Figure 12.3 "Balance Sheet and Income Statement for Home Store, Inc."</a>), the company must have purchased inventory with a cost of $612,000 during the period (= $66,000 + $546,000). Thus more cash was paid for merchandise ($612,000) than was reflected on the income statement as cost of goods sold ($546,000). If expenses are higher using a cash basis, the adjustment must decrease net income. Therefore $66,000 is deducted from net income in the operating activities section of the statement of cash flows. This information is summarized in the merchandise inventory T-account in the following.</p>

The higher the account goes; the more it reduces assets. This is why the change column shows this account as decreasing assets.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch12_s04_s02_p09">Two items caused the change in the accumulated depreciation account.

One noncurrent liability item (bonds payable) and two owners’ equity items (common stock and retained earnings) must be analyzed to determine how to present cash flow information in the financing activities section.

                <li>The statement of cash flows is prepared using the four steps described in the previous segment. In step 1, the indirect method starts with net income in the operating activities section and makes three types of adjustments to convert net income to a cash basis. The first adjustment is adding back expenses that do not affect cash, such as depreciation. The second adjustment is adding back losses and deducting gains related to investing activities. The third adjustment is adding and subtracting changes in current assets (except cash) and current liabilities using the adjustment rules. Steps 2 and 3 are done by analyzing and presenting cash activities associated with noncurrent assets (investing activities) and noncurrent liabilities and owners’ equity (financing activities). Step 4 shows that the change in cash on the statement of cash flows agrees with the change in cash on the balance sheet.</li>

In fact, financial results presented to the investing public typically focus on earnings per share (<a class="xref" href="heisinger_1.0-ch13#heisinger_1.0-ch13">Chapter 13 "How Do Managers Use Financial and Nonfinancial Performance Measures?"</a> discusses earnings per share in detail). However, analysis of cash flow information is becoming increasingly important to managers, auditors, and outside analysts. </em><em class="emphasis bolditalic">What measures are commonly used to evaluate performance related to cash flows?</em></p>
    <p class="para block"> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch12_s05_p02">Answer: Three common cash flow measures used to evaluate organizations are (1) operating cash flow ratio, (2) capital expenditure ratio, and (3) free cash flow. (Further coverage of these measures can be found in the following article: John R. Mills and Jeanne H.

This implies shareholders should be most interested in <em class="emphasis">free cash flow per share</em> rather than <em class="emphasis">earnings per share</em>. Mr. Bezos goes on to state, “Cash flow statements often don’t receive as much attention as they deserve. Discerning investors don’t stop with the income statement.”</p>

The adjustment rule used to convert sales to cash receipts from customers is as follows: increases in accounts receivable are <em class="emphasis">deducted</em> from sales revenue, and conversely, decreases in accounts receivable are <em class="emphasis">added</em> to sales revenue. Since accounts receivable for Home Store, Inc., increased $60,000, a deduction of $60,000 from sales revenue must be taken to find cash receipts from customers. Thus cash receipts from customers totaled $840,000 (= $900,000 sales − $60,000 increase in accounts receivable). The accounts receivable T-account shown in the following further clarifies this concept.</p>

Since inventory for Home Store, Inc., increased $66,000, cost of goods sold is increased $66,000.

        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch12_s06_s07_p02">Answer: Income tax expense of $65,000 shown on the income statement does not represent cash paid for income taxes. The adjustment rule used to convert income tax expense to cash payments for income taxes is: Increases in income taxes payable are <em class="emphasis">deducted</em> from income tax expense, and conversely, decreases in income taxes payable are <em class="emphasis">added</em> to income tax expense. (The same rules apply to companies that have <em class="emphasis">deferred income taxes</em>.) Since income taxes payable decreased $9,000, income tax expense is increased $9,000. Thus cash payments for income taxes totaled $74,000 (= $65,000 income tax expense + $9,000 decrease in income taxes payable).</p>

                <li>The same four steps apply to preparing the statement of cash flows using the direct method as with the indirect method. The difference is in the operating activities section of step 1. In step 1, the indirect method starts with net income and makes adjustments to convert net income to a cash basis. The direct method makes adjustments directly to each income statement revenue and expense line item, thereby converting each line item to a cash basis. The resulting cash provided by (used by) operating activities is identical in both approaches.</li>
