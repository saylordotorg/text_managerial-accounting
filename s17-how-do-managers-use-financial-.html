The company operates hundreds of restaurants throughout North America and is choosing between two suppliers of soft drinks: Deep Fizz Company and Extreme Fizz, Inc. Consumer surveys indicate no significant preference between the two. Sandy is meeting with Dave Roberts, the CFO, and Karen Kraft, the purchasing manager, to discuss the company’s options.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch13_p02">Chicken Deluxe is facing a supplier decision common to many companies. Financial stability is an important factor in deciding on a supplier, along with the quality of product and reliability of service. Chicken Deluxe must analyze financial information for Deep Fizz and Extreme Fizz to determine the financial condition of each company.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch13_p03">The analysis of a company’s financial information typically follows a three-pronged approach. First, trends within a company’s own financial information are analyzed, such as sales and earnings from one year to the next, using two methods—<em class="emphasis">trend analysis</em> and <em class="emphasis">common-size analysis</em>. Second, financial measures are compared between competitors. Finally, financial ratios are compared to industry averages. We discuss these three approaches next using <strong class="emphasis bold">Coca-Cola</strong> as an example. We will revisit the decision facing Chicken Deluxe later in the chapter.</p>

The increase in selling and administrative expenses of $1,800,000,000, or 15.8 percent, outpaced the increase in net sales, resulting in a relatively small increase in operating income of $218,000,000, or 2.6 percent. The significant increase in other income (expenses), net of 555.6 percent relates to a one-time gain of $4,978,000,000 resulting from <strong class="emphasis bold">Coca-Cola’s</strong> acquisition of <strong class="emphasis bold">Coca-Cola Enterprises, Inc.,</strong> in 2010 (this information comes from the notes to the financial statements).

This is important as we continue our analysis of <strong class="emphasis bold">Coca-Cola Company</strong> throughout the chapter. Net income will appear to have an unusually large increase as we cover various measures of performance, but keep in mind that the one-time gain in 2010 of $4,978,000,000 caused most of the increase from 2009 to 2010.</p>

Of course, total liabilities and shareholders’ equity also increased by the same amount. The increases identified in almost every asset, liability, and shareholders’ equity line item are significant. From reading the notes to the financial statements, the authors were able to identify the main source of these increases. In 2010, <strong class="emphasis bold">Coca-Cola</strong> acquired the remaining 67 percent of <strong class="emphasis bold">Coca-Cola Enterprises, Inc.’s (CCE)</strong> North America business that <strong class="emphasis bold">Coca-Cola</strong> did not already own. This resulted in significant increases in noncurrent assets and noncurrent liabilities, which were acquired as part of this transaction. It also resulted in the reporting of a one-time gain on the income statement of $4,978,000,000, which came from <strong class="emphasis bold">Coca-Cola</strong> remeasuring its equity interest in <strong class="emphasis bold">CCE</strong> to fair value upon close of the transaction in 2010.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch13_s02_s02_p01"><em class="emphasis">Question: To this point, we have used common-size analysis to evaluate just one company, </em><strong class="emphasis bold">Coca-Cola</strong><em class="emphasis">. Common-size analysis is, however, also an effective way of comparing two companies with different levels of revenues and assets. For example, suppose one company has operating income of $100,000, and a competing company has operating income of $2,000,000. If both companies have similar levels of net sales and total assets, it is reasonable to assume that the more profitable company is the better performer. However, most companies are not the same size. </em><em class="emphasis bolditalic">How do we compare companies of different sizes?</em></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch13_s02_s02_p04">Common-size analysis enables us to compare companies on equal ground, and as this analysis shows, <strong class="emphasis bold">Coca-Cola</strong> is outperforming <strong class="emphasis bold">PepsiCo</strong> in terms of income statement information.

        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch13_s02_s02_p05">Common-size analysis is obviously crucial to comparative analysis. In fact, some sources of industry data present the information exclusively in a common-size format, and most of the accounting software available today has been engineered to facilitate this type of analysis.</p>

            <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch13_s02_s02_p06">Most accounting computer programs, including QuickBooks, Peachtree, and MAS 90, provide common-size analysis reports. You simply select the appropriate report format and financial statement date, and the system prints the report. Thus accountants using this type of software can focus more on analyzing common-size information than on preparing it.</p>

For example, assume a company has equity of $10,000 earning 10 percent. The company can leverage this equity by borrowing $8,000 with a 6 percent interest rate. Assuming the company uses this $8,000 to purchase assets that earn 10 percent, the company has created positive financial leverage since the cost of borrowing is lower than the return on assets. This results in a return on equity that is higher than the return on assets. (Note: For a one-year period, the return on assets is $1,800 [= $18,000 × 10 percent] less the cost of debt of $480 [= 6 percent × $8,000], or $1,320. This results in a return on assets of 7.3 percent [= $1,320 ÷ $18,000]. Positive financial leverage causes the return on equity to be much higher at 13.2 percent [= $1,320 ÷ $10,000 equity].)</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch13_s03_s01_s04_p08">Although some level of financial leverage is generally regarded as healthy, companies that are highly leveraged tend to be riskier than similar companies with less leverage.

            <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch13_s03_s01_s05_p05">The earnings per share amount at <strong class="emphasis bold">Coca-Cola</strong> indicates the company earned $5.12 for each share of common stock outstanding. This ratio increased from 2009 to 2010. Although earnings per share is useful for looking at trends over time <em class="emphasis">within</em> a company, it cannot be compared in any meaningful way from one company to another because different companies have different numbers of shares outstanding.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch13_s03_s01_s05_p06">For example, assume two identical companies earn $10,000 for the year. One company has one share of common stock outstanding, and the other has two shares outstanding. Thus one company has earnings per share of $10,000 (= $10,000 ÷ 1 share) and the other company has earnings per share of $5,000 (= $10,000 ÷ 2 shares). The second company is not performing any worse; it simply has more shares outstanding. This is why you should not compare earnings per share across companies. (Alternative terms: Earnings per share are often called <em class="emphasis">EPS</em> or <em class="emphasis">income per share</em>.)</p>

                <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch13_s03_s01_s05_p07">The business press often uses earnings per share to announce a company’s earnings. For example, the Associated Press addressed earnings at <strong class="emphasis bold">AnnTaylor Stores Corporation</strong>, a retailer of women’s clothing, as follows: “Quarterly income fell to $7,100,000, or 10 cents per share, from $30,100,000, or 41 cents, the year before. Setting aside relocation costs, adjusted earnings were 18 cents per share, a penny higher than the average estimate from analysts polled by Thomson Financial.”</p>
                <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch13_s03_s01_s05_p08">This quote demonstrates not only that earnings per share data are important when announcing a company’s earnings but also that analysts use these data when making predictions about a company’s performance. A quick perusal of any business publication, such as <em class="emphasis">The Wall Street Journal</em>, or a review of online business press releases at sites like <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://finance.yahoo.com">http://finance.yahoo.com</a> will confirm that earnings per share data are commonly used to announce a company’s financial results.</p>

Although inventory is typically excluded from the numerator, further analysis is needed to evaluate whether inventory should be included. For example, grocery stores turn inventory over very quickly, typically within a couple of weeks, and should consider including inventory in the quick ratio. Producers of wine, on the other hand, turn inventory over very slowly, and should consider excluding inventory in the numerator of the quick ratio. For the sake of consistency, you should exclude inventory from the numerator in this chapter, unless told otherwise. (Note: Many companies provide two quick ratio calculations, one that includes inventory in the numerator and one that excludes inventory in the numerator. If two ratios are presented, it is important to label each ratio to indicate whether inventory has been included or excluded.)</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch13_s03_s02_s02_p04">It is helpful when reviewing a company’s balance sheet to remember that current assets are presented in order of liquidity, with the most liquid current asset appearing first and the least liquid appearing last. This helps in determining whether a particular current asset should be included or excluded in the numerator of the quick ratio. The quick ratio for <strong class="emphasis bold">Coca-Cola</strong> for 2010 is calculated as follows, with <strong class="emphasis bold">PepsiCo</strong> and industry average information following it:</p>

                <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch13_s03_s04_s01_p07">Most investors refer to market capitalization as <em class="emphasis">market cap</em>. Companies are typically classified into one of three market cap categories: small-cap, midcap, and large-cap. In general, small-cap companies have a market value of less than $1,000,000,000, midcap companies have a market value between $1,000,000,000 and $12,000,000,000, and large-cap companies have a market value greater than $12,000,000,000.</p>
                <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch13_s03_s04_s01_p08">Thus small-cap mutual funds are stock funds that invest in companies with a market value of less than $1,000,000,000. Midcap mutual funds are stock funds that invest in companies with a market value between $1,000,000,000 and $12,000,000,000, and so on. These categories are important to investors because the stocks of small-cap companies tend to be more volatile than those of mid- or large-cap companies.</p>

                    <li>Shareholders, creditors, and analysts often evaluate a company’s profitability. Five ratios used to evaluate <em class="emphasis">profitability</em> are the gross margin ratio, the profit margin ratio, return on assets, return on common shareholders’ equity, and earnings per share. Suppliers and other short-term creditors often evaluate whether a company can meet short-term obligations. Four ratios used to evaluate <em class="emphasis">short-term liquidity</em> are the current ratio, the quick ratio, the receivables turnover ratio (often converted to average collection period), and the inventory turnover ratio (often converted to average sale period). Banks, bondholders, and other long-term lenders often evaluate whether companies can meet long-term obligations. Three ratios used to evaluate <em class="emphasis">long-term solvency</em> are debt to assets, debt to equity, and times interest earned.

For example, airlines track on-time arrival percentages carefully, and delivery companies like </em><em class="emphasis bolditalic">Federal Express (FedEx) </em><em class="emphasis">and </em><em class="emphasis bolditalic">United Parcel Service (UPS) </em><em class="emphasis">monitor percentages of on-time deliveries.

    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch13_s05_p02">Answer: The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">balanced scorecard</a><span class="glossdef">A balanced set of financial and nonfinancial measures used by organizations to motivate employees and evaluate performance.</span></span> is a balanced set of measures that organizations use to motivate employees and evaluate performance. These measures are typically separated into four perspectives outlined in the following. (Dr. Robert S. Kaplan and Dr. David P. Norton created the balanced scorecard, and it is actively promoted through their company, Balanced Scorecard Collaborative. More information can be found at the company’s Web site at <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.bscol.com">http://www.bscol.com</a>.)</p>

    </ol>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch13_s05_p03">The goal is to link these four perspectives to the company’s strategies and goals. For example, a high percentage of on-time arrivals is likely an important goal from the perspective of the <em class="emphasis">customer</em> of an airline. A high percentage of defect-free computer chips is likely an important goal from the <em class="emphasis">internal business process</em> perspective of a computer chip maker. A high number of continuing education hours is likely an important goal from the <em class="emphasis">learning and growth</em> perspective for tax personnel at an accounting firm. Measures from a <em class="emphasis">financial</em> perspective were covered earlier in this chapter.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch13_s05_p04">Companies that use the balanced scorecard typically establish several measures for each perspective. <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch13_s05_t01">Table 13.4 "Balanced Scorecard Measures"</a> lists several examples of these measures.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch13_s05_p05">Measures established across the four perspectives of the balanced scorecard are linked in a way that motivates employees to achieve company goals. For example, if the company wants to increase the defect-free rate and reduce product returns, effective employee training and low employee turnover will help in achieving this goal. The idea is to establish company goals first, then create measures that motivate employees to reach company goals.</p>

The company has encountered a cash shortage resulting from collection problems with several customers. If Custom Tech is unable to collect a significant portion of its receivables relatively soon, the company will not be able to pay suppliers and employees next quarter. As a result, Custom Tech’s president, Don Lardner, began discussions with a local bank about obtaining a short-term loan. Don did not mention the cause of the cash flow shortage other than to say, “This happens the same time every year due to the cyclical nature of our business.”</p>
                <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch13_s05_p58">In a meeting with the bank’s loan officer, Jan Johnson, Don was told the loan should not be a problem as long as Custom Tech maintains a profit margin ratio above 10 percent, quick ratio above 1.0 to 1, and debt to equity ratio below 1.4 to 1. Don indicated this was in line with his company’s performance and agreed to provide financial statements for the most recent year at their next meeting.</p>
