(Segments are often called divisions or subunits.) For example, universities are often segmented by discipline with one manager, or dean, responsible for each discipline (physical education, social sciences, business, etc.). Retail companies are often segmented by region, with one manager responsible for each region. Service companies are often segmented by service category, with one manager responsible for each category (e.g., an accounting firm divided into audit and tax). Decentralization is not limited to a particular type of organization, and most organizations that have grown in size and complexity decentralize to some extent.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Reasons to Decentralize</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch11_s01_s01_p01"><em class="emphasis">Question: </em><em class="emphasis bolditalic">Why do organizations decentralize operations?</em></p>
        <p class="para block"> </p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch11_s01_s01_p02">Answer: Organizations often decentralize out of necessity as they expand. The responsibility of one manager, or group of managers, to run the entire organization can become overwhelming as the number of products offered increases.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch11_s01_s01_p03">For example, Game Products, Inc., began by selling two board games to several retail stores in the northeast United States. The company did not need to decentralize at that point because it offered only two products and the geographic region in which it sold those products was limited.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch11_s01_s01_p04">A few years later, Game Products expanded sales to Canada and the southeast Unites States, while also venturing into the computer games industry by purchasing a small maker of computer games. Although operations were not decentralized at this time—all decisions were still made at headquarters—top management was beginning to feel the strain of trying to manage two segments of the company. The decision-making process was cumbersome and slow, and the company began to miss market opportunities that would have increased sales and profits.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch11_s01_s01_p05">Two years later, Game Products decided to enter the sporting goods market, and top management and the board of directors agreed that decentralization was critical to the future success of the company. As a result, they assigned a manager to run each division. This change allowed top management to concentrate on high-level issues. such as long-range strategic planning, and it placed the decision making in the hands of managers who were intimately familiar with the operations of their individual divisions.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch11_s01_s01_p06">Although Game Products ultimately decided to decentralize operations, there are advantages and disadvantages to decentralizing. <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch11_s01_s01_f01">Figure 11.1 "Decentralized Versus Centralized Organizations"</a> illustrates how operations would look at Game Products, Inc., if operations were decentralized or if they remained centralized.</p>

        <p class="para block"> </p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch11_s01_s02_p02">Answer: Organizations like Game Products tend to decentralize as their operations grow and become more complex. The advantages of decentralizing are as follows:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch11_s01_s02_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Increased Expertise.</strong> Rather than having one manager, or a group of managers, trying to make decisions for a wide range of products, decentralized organizations delegate decision-making authority to local managers who have expertise in specific products.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Quicker Decisions.</strong> By having increased expertise and decision-making authority, local managers are able to make decisions quickly without having to wait for the approval of the organization’s top management.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Refocus of Top Management Responsibilities.</strong> With local managers focusing on issues important to the specific segment, top management is able to delegate the day-to-day decision-making responsibilities and focus on broader companywide issues, such as long-range strategic planning.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Motivation of Local Managers.</strong> Managers who are given more responsibility, and the control necessary to manage their responsibility, tend to be more motivated than those who simply follow the orders issued by top management. In addition, a decentralized structure provides a means to train local managers for promotion to the next level of management.</li>

            <p class="simpara">Advantages of Decentralizing at a Community College</p>
            <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch11_s01_s02_p04"><strong class="emphasis bold">Sierra College</strong> is located in one of the fastest growing counties in California. Student enrollment has increased from 5 percent to 10 percent per year over the last decade. Prior to this rapid growth, the college held each division dean responsible for most administrative duties. For example, the dean of business and technology was responsible for administrative duties, such as hiring faculty members and developing the schedule of classes to be offered each semester.</p>
            <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch11_s01_s02_p05">As student enrollment increased, course offerings expanded, and faculty headcount grew into the hundreds, the administrative duties became overwhelming for each division dean. As a result, management decided to decentralize further by creating department chair positions to help with the administrative duties related directly to each department. This change gave each department (business, music, computer science, etc.) more control over day-to-day activities, and it allowed the deans to focus on larger college issues, such as strategic planning and community relations. It also allowed for quicker responses to issues, such as faculty teaching assignments and classroom space utilization.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Disadvantages of Decentralizing Operations</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch11_s01_s03_p01"><em class="emphasis">Question: </em><em class="emphasis bolditalic">What are the disadvantages of decentralizing operations for organizations, such as Game Products?</em></p>
        <p class="para block"> </p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch11_s01_s03_p02">Answer: The results of decentralizing operations are not always positive. Three disadvantages of decentralizing are as follows:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch11_s01_s03_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Duplication of Services.</strong> Organizations that decentralize often duplicate administrative services, such as accounting and computer support. That is, each segment may have its own accounting department and computer support department when these services might be provided more efficiently through one companywide department.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Conflict of Interest.</strong> Managers who are evaluated solely with respect to their divisions have no incentive to make a decision that benefits the organization as a whole at the expense of the manager’s division. For example, a local manager may decide to purchase raw materials from an outside supplier even though another division within the company can produce the same materials at a lower cost. (To make matters worse, the other division’s manager may refuse to sell the materials at a reduced price because she is evaluated based on her division’s profits!) The appendix to this chapter discusses this issue in greater detail.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Loss of Control.</strong> Perhaps one of the most difficult decisions facing small, fast-growing organizations is whether to continue to expand and decentralize or to limit growth and remain highly centralized. Decentralization will lead to a loss of control at top management levels, which can have negative consequences for the organization’s reputation if local managers struggle to maintain the level of quality that customers expect. Decentralized organizations are only as good as the local managers who are given decision-making authority.</li>

            <p class="simpara">Disadvantage of Decentralizing an Accounting Firm</p>
            <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch11_s01_s03_p03"><strong class="emphasis bold">Arthur Andersen</strong> was a large, decentralized accounting firm with offices located throughout the world. One or more partners operated each office independently. In 2002, <strong class="emphasis bold">Arthur Andersen</strong> had 85,000 employees worldwide. The firm was indicted in March 2002, and later found guilty, for obstructing justice by shredding tons of documents related to its audit work for <strong class="emphasis bold">Enron Corporation</strong>. As a result, <strong class="emphasis bold">Arthur Andersen</strong> agreed to cease its accounting practice in the United States in August 2002. By 2005, only 200 employees remained at <strong class="emphasis bold">Arthur Andersen</strong> to wrap up the dissolution of the firm.</p>
            <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch11_s01_s03_p04">Although the entire firm was indicted and found guilty of obstruction of justice, the decision to shred documents was made at the Houston office, where the bulk of the shredding took place. This serves as an extreme example of the disadvantage of decentralizing an organization. Decisions left to the division managers (“partners” in this case) can have a negative effect on the entire organization.</p>
            <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch11_s01_s03_p05">Note that the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the guilty verdict of the U.S. District Court in June 2005, but the damage was done and the firm did not survive.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch11_s02_p02">Answer: The purpose of establishing responsibility centers within organizations is to hold managers responsible for only the assets, revenues, and costs they can control. For example, a factory manager typically has control over production costs, but not sales. This manager’s responsibility center would only include production costs. A retail store manager typically has control over sales prices and costs. This manager’s responsibility center would only include revenues and costs.

        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch11_s03_s01_p03">Although this income statement looks much like a financial accounting income statement prepared for outside users, it is for internal use and therefore, need not comply with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (U.S. GAAP). In fact, organizations can define income or profit many different ways when evaluating performance. For example, some might only look at operating income, others might exclude allocated overhead from operating income. Another alternative is to focus on gross margin. The point is that managerial accountants must be flexible in designing reports that best meet the needs of managers.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch11_s03_s01_p04">The president of Game Products, Inc., referred to net income when she indicated that the Board Games division performed very well for the year. Solely based on this measure, Mandy’s statement is accurate as the Board Games division has net income of $3,466,000 versus $2,306,000 for the Sporting Goods division and $1,577,000 for the Computer Games division.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Limitations of Using Segmented Income to Measure Performance</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch11_s03_s02_p01"><em class="emphasis">Question: Although using net income for each division as a performance measure is relatively simple, there are two significant weaknesses. </em><em class="emphasis bolditalic">What are these weaknesses?</em></p>
        <p class="para block"> </p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch11_s03_s02_p02">Answer: First, not all divisions are of equal size. Naturally, larger divisions should produce larger profits. It is unfair to compare net income for a smaller division with net income for a larger division for the purpose of evaluating division manager performance. With $34,000,000 in sales, the Board Games division should be expected to have higher net income than the other divisions, each of which has sales of less than $30,000,000.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch11_s03_s02_p03">One solution is to compare profit margin ratios for each division (net income ÷ sales). As shown at the bottom of <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch11_s03_s01_f01">Figure 11.3 "Segmented Income Statements (Game Products, Inc.)"</a>, the Sporting Goods division has the highest profit margin ratio at 11.53 percent, compared to 10.19 percent for Board Games, and 5.44 percent for Computer Games. (<a class="xref" href="heisinger_1.0-ch13#heisinger_1.0-ch13">Chapter 13 "How Do Managers Use Financial and Nonfinancial Performance Measures?"</a> presents several additional financial ratios used to evaluate performance.)</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch11_s03_s02_p04">Because each division manager has control over revenues, costs, <em class="emphasis">and investments in assets</em>, each division is considered an investment center. Thus a second weakness in using segmented net income information to evaluate division manager performance is that net income as the sole measure of performance ignores the assets used to produce net income.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch11_s03_s02_p05">For example, suppose the Sporting Goods division only invested approximately $29,000,000 in assets to produce $2,306,000 in income, while the Board Games division invested $55,000,000 in assets to produce $3,466,000 in income. Which division had the best performance? We need a measure to evaluate how well each division performed relative to the investments made. We discuss three such measures next.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch11_s04_p03">Note that different organizations use different measures to calculate ROI. Our goal in this discussion is to introduce one common approach, but keep in mind that organizations often make adjustments to this formula to better suit their needs.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch11_s04_p04">The advantage of ROI as a performance measure is that it includes the use of assets. For example, assume 2 divisions have $10,000 in operating income. Both divisions appear to have performed equally well based on operating income. However, further review shows that Division 1 invested $200,000 in average operating assets to produce this income while Division 2 invested $400,000. Clearly, the division that invested half the amount in assets to produce the same amount of income had the best performance of the two. Comparing the ROI for each division proves this:</p>

Examples of operating assets include cash, accounts receivable, prepaid assets, buildings, and equipment.

Examples of nonoperating assets—assets not included in this calculation—include land held for investment purposes and office buildings leased to other companies.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch11_s04_s01_p05">An average of operating assets is taken over the period being evaluated for two reasons. First, operating assets are often purchased and sold during an accounting period, and simply taking the ending balance might produce distorted, if not inaccurate, results. Second, operating income represents information for a period of time (income statements always present information for a <em class="emphasis">period of time</em>), while operating assets are presented at a point in time (balance sheets always present information for a <em class="emphasis">point in time</em>). If both of these items are to be included in one ratio (ROI), it is best to use average balance information for balance sheet items. In fact, if the information is readily available, it would be best to take an average of daily operating asset balances for the period being evaluated.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch11_s04_s03_s02_s01_p01">In the Game Products, Inc., example, we use the net book value of long-term assets to calculate operating assets. That is, accumulated depreciation is subtracted from the original cost on the segmented balance sheet in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The balance sheet presented in <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch11_s04_s02_f01">Figure 11.4 "Segmented Balance Sheets (Game Products, Inc.)"</a> shows this in the line item labeled <em class="emphasis">property, plant, and equipment, net</em>. The advantage of using net book value is that the information is easily obtained from the financial records.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch11_s04_s03_s02_s01_p02">The problem with this approach is division managers with older assets that have been substantially depreciated have an advantage over division managers with newer assets that have not been significantly depreciated. Older assets have a lower net book value (cost – accumulated depreciation) than newer assets, which reduces average operating assets in the denominator and increases ROI.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch11_s04_s03_s02_s01_p03">For example, assume two divisions have identical operating income for the year and identical assets. However, Division 1 has been in operation for many more years than Division 2 and thus has far more accumulated depreciation on long-term assets. This results in a lower net book value on long-term assets for Division 1 as shown in the following:</p>
                <div class="informalfigure large block">

(Reducing the denominator increases the ratio.)</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch11_s04_s03_s02_s01_p05">An additional weakness in using net book value to calculate average operating assets is the disincentive it creates for division managers to replace old and inefficient long-term assets, such as equipment and machinery. Although new equipment purchases may be needed to improve efficiency and to remain competitive, the short-term impact is to reduce ROI. (Older equipment will have a lower net book value than identical newer equipment. Thus replacing old equipment will decrease ROI.)</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch11_s04_s03_s02_s01_p06">If division managers are evaluated based on ROI, using net book value tends to discourage investments in long-term assets, often at the expense of the organization’s long-term profitability.</p>

This investment totals $70,000 and annual operating profit will be $10,500 (15 percent ROI = $10,500 ÷ $70,000). Although this investment is well above the company’s minimum required rate of return, the division manager will likely not make the investment since the division’s overall ROI will decline from 20 percent to 17.9 percent:</p>

As shown in this example, using RI as a performance measure is an effective way to minimize the conflict between company goals and division goals that arise using ROI. Rather than maximizing ROI, division managers focus on increasing RI. Managers are more likely to accept investment proposals that have a return greater than the company’s minimum required rate of return, regardless of the impact on the division’s ROI.</p>

One division may have high RI simply because it has a larger asset base, which produces higher revenues.

    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch11_s06_l02">
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Research and development.</strong> U.S. GAAP requires that R&amp;D costs be expensed as incurred. However, R&amp;D work typically benefits the company in future periods. EVA capitalizes R&amp;D costs (that is, records these costs as a long-term asset) and amortizes these costs over the estimated useful life of R&amp;D activities.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Advertising.</strong> U.S. GAAP also requires that advertising costs be expensed as incurred. Since marketing efforts typically benefit the company in future periods, EVA capitalizes these costs and amortizes them over a period of time.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Noninterest bearing current liabilities.</strong> EVA requires deducting noninterest bearing current liabilities from average operating assets. This is because current liabilities that do not require an interest payment are a free source of capital. For example, a company purchasing large amounts of inventory (an asset) on account has a free source of capital, which is presented as a noninterest bearing current liability on the balance sheet.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch11_s06_p06">These three items are provided as examples of adjustments proposed by EVA advocates. However, the adjustments made depend on the organization since EVA calculations are modified to fit the needs of the organization.</p>

These amounts were used earlier in the chapter to calculate segmented net income, ROI, and RI. Notice that research and development costs are now shown as a separate line item on the income statement, and average balances are shown on the balance sheet rather than beginning and ending balances. (Average balances are simply beginning balances plus ending balances divided by two.)</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch11_s06_s01_p03">To simplify our analysis, we make only two adjustments—one for research and development and one for noninterest bearing current liabilities. The management believes research and development activities benefit future periods and would like to capitalize R&amp;D costs and amortize these costs over several years. In addition, all current liabilities are noninterest bearing liabilities and as such will be deducted from average operating assets.</p>

On the income statement, R&amp;D expense for the year shown in <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch11_s06_s01_f01">Figure 11.9 "Income Statement and Balance Sheet Information (Game Products, Inc.)"</a> is added back to operating income; R&amp;D amortization expense for one year will be deducted as an expense.

        <p class="para block"> </p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch11_s06_s01_p08">Answer: As shown at the bottom of <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch11_s06_s01_f02">Figure 11.10 "EVA Calculations (Game Products, Inc.)"</a>, all three divisions have positive EVA amounts, which indicates all three have NOPAT (adjusted) in excess of each division’s cost of investment funds (adjusted).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch11_s06_s01_p09">Recall from the example in <a class="xref" href="heisinger_1.0-ch11_s05#heisinger_1.0-ch11_s05_s03_f01">Figure 11.8 "RI Calculations (Game Products, Inc.)"</a> that Computer Games was the only division with negative RI. This negative amount turns to a positive amount using EVA mainly because research and development costs are capitalized and amortized over future years rather than expensed as incurred. Because the Computer Games division had significant research and development costs, and these costs were backed out and recorded as an asset using EVA, NOPAT (adjusted) increased significantly. This caused the EVA amount for Computer Games to become positive.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch11_s06_s02_p01"><em class="emphasis">Question: While EVA is no doubt a popular method for evaluating investment centers, and companies as a whole, there are weaknesses in its approach. </em><em class="emphasis bolditalic">What are these weaknesses?</em></p>
        <p class="para block"> </p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch11_s06_s02_p02">Answer: As stated earlier, EVA is similar to RI except adjustments are made to operating income and average operating assets to offset accounting anomalies created by U.S. GAAP. Critics of EVA argue that U.S. GAAP was established for a variety of reasons, one of which was to provide a set of reasonable and objective accounting rules to be followed when recording economic events. Modifying U.S. GAAP to calculate EVA strays from the objectivity provided by U.S. GAAP.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch11_s06_s02_p03">For example, U.S. GAAP requires R&amp;D and advertising costs to be expensed in the period incurred because it is very difficult and subjective to estimate the future benefit these activities may provide. EVA adjustments described earlier for R&amp;D and advertising costs depart from U.S. GAAP. EVA recommends that these costs be capitalized and amortized over the useful life of the activity. This leads to different interpretations of what the useful life should be. Managers now have an incentive to stretch useful lives out as far as possible to minimize amortization expense taken each period.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch11_s06_s02_p04">As with any performance measure, EVA has advantages and disadvantages. The key is to develop a measure that promotes behavior desired by top management and to provide consistency in evaluating managers.</p>

If division managers are evaluated based only on division results using measures, such as segmented net income, profit margin ratio, or return on investment (ROI), conflicts can arise causing managers to take a course of action that benefits the division but hurts the company as a whole. For example, a division manager may decide to purchase raw materials from an outside supplier even though the same materials can be produced at a lower cost by another division within the company (the other division’s manager refuses to sell the materials at a reduced price because she is evaluated based on her division’s profits!). </em><em class="emphasis bolditalic">How should a company establish transfer pricing to avoid this kind of conflict?</em></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch11_s08_s01_p03">Let’s look at an example illustrating how to establish a reasonable transfer price using the economic transfer pricing rule.

Although Marketing looks better as an investment center buying from the outside for $7 because the cost is $2 less than the internal transfer price, the overall company is worse off because the $7 cost is $1 higher than if the umbrellas were produced internally.</p>

The selling division manager prefers to cover all costs rather than only variable costs, and using full-absorption cost accomplishes this goal. However, the company’s concern is the buying division might choose to purchase from an outside provider at a higher price than the differential cost plus opportunity cost but lower than the selling division’s full absorption cost. The result is a decision that does not maximize company profit.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch11_s08_s03_p02">Answer: Investment center division managers are often expected to act independent of each other. In fact, many companies treat investment centers as separate businesses. To promote the autonomy of each division manager, companies often require the buying and selling divisions to negotiate a transfer price. This sounds reasonable in concept, but the same weakness exists here as with using costs to set a transfer price. The buying division may choose to purchase the goods or services from an outside supplier if negotiations break down, which may lead to a suboptimal decision for the company as a whole.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch11_s08_s03_p03">An additional weakness is the time required to negotiate a transfer price. Managers can spend significant amounts of time in negotiations when the time might be better spent more productively elsewhere in the division.</p>

One member on the committee, Chris Carson, would like to offer the CEO a multiyear extension with a significant bump in salary and thousands of shares of stock options. When questioned why, Chris pointed to the positive results reflected on the income statement.</p>
                    <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch11_s08_s04_p59">Another committee member, Mary Nichols, agrees with Chris that income statement trends look great, but she would like to review other measures of performance as well. Mary has asked you to come up with two measures of performance that go beyond simply looking at the income statement.</p>
