Direct labor has two separate standards as well: standard <em class="emphasis">hours</em> to produce 1 unit of product (0.10 hours) and standard <em class="emphasis">rate</em> ($13 per hour). Variable manufacturing overhead also has 2 separate standards: standard <em class="emphasis">hours</em> to produce 1 unit of product (0.10 direct labor hours) and standard <em class="emphasis">rate</em> ($5 per hour). Thus there are two separate standards necessary to establish each standard cost or six standards in total to establish a standard cost for direct materials, direct labor, and variable manufacturing overhead.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch10_s02_s02_p03">As we explain next, there are many approaches to establishing these six standards for direct materials, direct labor, and variable manufacturing overhead (we discuss <em class="emphasis">fixed</em> manufacturing overhead at the end of this chapter).</p>

For Jerry’s Ice Cream, the standard quantity of materials needed for each gallon of product is given in the recipe. Jerry’s adds a certain amount to the recipe quantity for waste and spoilage. Similar to this approach, companies might find the standard quantity in the product specifications outlined by product engineers.
