    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch04_p01">Ann Watkins owns and operates a company that mass produces wood desks used in classrooms throughout the world. Ann’s company, Desk Products, Inc., maintains an advantage over its competitors by producing one desk in large quantities—4,000 to 8,000 desks per month—using a universally accepted design. This enables the company to buy materials in bulk, often leading to volume price discounts from suppliers. Because the exact same desk is produced for all customers, Desk Products purchases precut wood materials from suppliers. As a result, Desk Products can limit the production process to two processing departments—Assembly and Finishing. The Assembly department requisitions precut materials and hardware from the raw materials storeroom, assembles each desk, and moves the assembled desks to the Finishing department. The Finishing department sands and paints each desk and moves completed desks to the finished goods warehouse.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch04_p02">A new competitor recently began producing a similar desk, and Ann is concerned about whether Desk Products’ production costs are reasonable. In particular, Ann is concerned about the costs in the Assembly department since this department is responsible for the majority of the company’s production costs. Ann talks with the accountant at Desk Products, John Fuller, to investigate.</p>

    <p class="para block"> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch04_s01_p02">Answer: Although these systems have marked differences, they are also similar in many ways. (As you read through this section, refer to <a class="xref" href="heisinger_1.0-ch01#heisinger_1.0-ch01">Chapter 1 "What Is Managerial Accounting?"</a> for a review of important terms if necessary.) Recall the three inventory accounts that accountants use to track product cost information—raw materials inventory, work-in-process inventory, and finished goods inventory. These three inventory accounts are used to record product cost information for both process costing and job costing systems. However, several work-in-process inventory accounts are typically used in a process costing system to track the flow of product costs through each production <em class="emphasis">department</em>. Thus each department has its own work-in-process inventory account. (For the purposes of this chapter, assume each department represents a production <em class="emphasis">process</em>. This explains the term <em class="emphasis">process costing</em> because we are tracking costs by process.) The sum of all work-in-process inventory accounts represents total work in process for the company.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch04_s01_p03">Recall the three components of product costs—direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead. Assigning these product costs to individual products remains an important goal for process costing, just as with job costing. However, instead of assigning product costs to individual <em class="emphasis">jobs</em> (shown on a job cost sheet), process costing assigns these costs to departments (shown on a departmental production cost report).</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch04_s01_p04"><a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch04_s01_f01">Figure 4.1 "A Comparison of Cost Flows for Job Costing and Process Costing"</a> shows how product costs flow through accounts for job costing and process costing systems. <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch04_s01_t01">Table 4.1 "A Comparison of Process Costing and Job Costing"</a> outlines the similarities and differences between these two costing systems.

            <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch04_s02_s06_p04">The <strong class="emphasis bold">Wrigley Company</strong> has 14 factories located in various parts of the world, including North America, Europe, Africa, India, and the Asia/Pacific region. The gum produced by these factories is sold in 150 countries. According to <strong class="emphasis bold">Wrigley Company</strong>, 50 percent of Americans chew gum, and on average, each person consumes 190 sticks per year. The number drops to 130 sticks per person in the United Kingdom and to 100 sticks per person in Taiwan.</p>

<strong class="emphasis bold">Melting.</strong> The gum base, which comes in small round balls, is melted and purified.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Mixing.</strong> The melted base is poured into a mixer, to which sweeteners and flavors are added.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Rolling.</strong> A large “loaf” of gum is sent through a series of rollers, thereby reducing thickness to the desired size.</li>
                <li>

                <li>The cost flows in a process costing system are similar to the cost flows in a job costing system. The primary difference between the two costing methods is that a process costing system assigns product costs—direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead—to each production department (or process) rather than to each job. Each production department has its own work-in-process inventory account when using process costing.</li>

The challenge is determining the unit cost of products being transferred out of each departmental work-in-process inventory account. We start the process of determining unit cost information with an important concept, the concept of equivalent units. </em><em class="emphasis bolditalic">What are equivalent units, and how are equivalent units calculated?</em></p>
    <p class="para block"> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch04_s03_p02">Answer: Units of product in work-in-process inventory are assumed to be <em class="emphasis">partially</em> completed; otherwise, the units would not be in work-in-process inventory. Process costing requires <em class="emphasis">partially</em> completed units in ending work-in-process inventory to be converted to the equivalent <em class="emphasis">completed</em> units (called <em class="emphasis">equivalent units</em>). <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Equivalent units</a><span class="glossdef">Partially completed units converted to the equivalent completed units; calculated by multiplying the number of physical units on hand by the percentage of completion of the physical units.</span></span> are calculated by multiplying the number of physical (or actual) units on hand by the percentage of completion of the units. If the physical units are 100 percent complete, equivalent units will be the same as the physical units. However, if the physical units are not 100 percent complete, the equivalent units will be less than the physical units.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch04_s03_p03">For example, if four physical units of product are 50 percent complete at the end of the period, an equivalent of two units has been completed (2 equivalent units = 4 physical units × 50 percent).

    <p class="para block"> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch04_s03_p06">Answer: Equivalent units in work in process are often different for direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead because these three components of production may enter the process at varying stages. For example, in the Assembly department at Desk Products, Inc., direct materials enter production early in the process while direct labor and overhead are used throughout the process. (Imagine asking workers to assemble desks without materials!) Thus equivalent units must be calculated for each of the three production costs. (Note that direct labor and manufacturing overhead are sometimes combined in a category called <em class="emphasis">conversion costs</em>, which assumes both are added to the process at the same time. In this text, we keep direct labor and manufacturing overhead separate.) The next section presents how we use the equivalent unit concept for product costing purposes. Be sure you understand the concept of equivalent units before moving on.</p>

        <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch04_s03_p07">The concept of an equivalent unit can be applied to determine the number of <em class="emphasis">full-time equivalent students (FTES)</em> at a school. Colleges use FTES data to plan and make decisions about course offerings, staffing, and facility needs. Although having information about the number of students enrolled (the <em class="emphasis">headcount</em>) is helpful, headcount data do not provide an indication of whether the students are full time or part time. Clearly, full-time students take more classes each term and generally use more resources than part-time students. Thus administrators often prefer to convert enrollment data to FTES.</p>
        <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch04_s03_p08">Using a simple example to explain this concept, assume 30 students attend school and each takes half a full load of classes. The headcount is 30. However, this is the equivalent of 15 full-time students, or 15 FTES.</p>
        <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch04_s03_p09">To apply this to the real world, let’s look at the enrollment data for <strong class="emphasis bold">Sierra College</strong>, a community college located near Sacramento, California. During a recent semester, the student headcount in a specific department at <strong class="emphasis bold">Sierra College</strong> was 8,190. Because a large number of students in the department were part time, the full-time equivalent number of students totaled 3,240.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch04_s05_s02_p02">Answer: When using information from the production cost report, managers must be careful not to assume that all production costs are variable costs. The CEO of Desk Products, Inc., Ann Watkins, was told that the Assembly department cost for each desk totaled $62 for the month of May (from <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch04_s05_f01">Figure 4.9 "Production Cost Report for Desk Products’ Assembly Department"</a>, step 3). However, if the company produces more or fewer units than were produced in May, the unit cost will change. This is because the $62 unit cost includes both variable and fixed costs (see <a class="xref" href="heisinger_1.0-ch05#heisinger_1.0-ch05">Chapter 5 "How Do Organizations Identify Cost Behavior Patterns?"</a> for a detailed discussion of fixed and variable costs).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch04_s05_s02_p03">Assume direct materials and direct labor are variable costs. In the Assembly department, the variable costs per unit associated with direct materials and direct labor of $50 (= $30 direct materials + $20 direct labor) will remain the same regardless of the level of production, within the relevant range. However, the remaining unit product cost of $12 associated with overhead must be analyzed further to determine the amount that is variable (e.g., indirect materials) and the amount that is fixed (e.g., factory rent). Managers must understand that fixed costs <em class="emphasis">per unit</em> will change depending on the level of production. More specifically, Ann Watkins must understand that the $62 unit cost in the Assembly department provided in the production cost report will change depending on the level of production. <a class="xref" href="heisinger_1.0-ch05#heisinger_1.0-ch05">Chapter 5 "How Do Organizations Identify Cost Behavior Patterns?"</a> provides a detailed presentation of how cost information can be separated into fixed and variable components for the purpose of providing managers with more useful information.</p>

Preliminary figures show current year net income before taxes totaling $1,970,000, which is short of the target by $30,000. The president approaches you and asks you to increase the percentage of completion for the 40,000 units in ending WIP inventory to 90 percent for direct materials and to 95 percent for direct labor and overhead. Even though you are confident in the percentages used to prepare the production cost report, which appears as follows, the president insists that his change is minor and will have little impact on how investors and creditors view the company.</p>
