    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch09_s03_p02">Answer: Study <a class="xref" href="heisinger_1.0-ch09_s02#heisinger_1.0-ch09_s02_f01">Figure 9.1 "Master Budget Schedules"</a> carefully, as it serves as the road map for the master budget presented throughout this chapter for Jerry’s Ice Cream. Notice that the budgeting process starts with the sales budget. Also, note that the budgets described next are for a manufacturing company. Manufacturing companies tend to have more budget schedules than other types of organizations because their operations are more complex. Once you understand budgeting in a manufacturing environment, you can easily modify the process to perform budgeting in other organizations, as discussed later in the chapter. As we work through the master budget for Jerry’s Ice Cream, assume the company prepares quarterly budgets.</p>

This is perhaps the most important budget as it drives most of the other budgets. For example, the production budget and related materials, labor, and overhead budgets are based on expected sales.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch09_s03_s01_p03">Forecasting sales often involves extensive research and numerous sources. Companies, such as Jerry’s Ice Cream, typically start with their sales staff since salespeople have daily contact with customers and direct information about customer demand. Some companies pay for market trend data to learn about industry and product trends. Many organizations hire market research consultants to obtain and review industry data and ultimately to predict customer demand. Larger companies sometimes employ economists to develop sophisticated models used to project sales. Smaller, less sophisticated organizations simply base their estimates on past trends. <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch09_s03_s01_f01">Figure 9.2 "Estimating Sales"</a> shows how companies obtain sales information from sales people, market research consultants, and economists.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch09_s03_s01_p04">Tom Benson, sales manager at Jerry’s Ice Cream, talked with his salespeople and reviewed market trends for ice cream using data obtained from a market research firm. His estimate, shown in <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch09_s03_s01_f02">Figure 9.3 "Sales Budget for Jerry’s Ice Cream"</a>, assumes the company will increase sales 15 percent this coming year. Thus, to get projected sales for quarter 1, Tom simply multiplied last year’s first quarter sales by 1.15. The average price per unit last year was $6 (1 unit = 1 gallon), and Tom does not expect any change in this price. The sales budget is presented in <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch09_s03_s01_f02">Figure 9.3 "Sales Budget for Jerry’s Ice Cream"</a>.</p>

However, most companies, including Jerry’s Ice Cream, maintain a certain level of finished goods inventory. Thus production is typically <em class="emphasis">not</em> the same as projected sales.

        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch09_s03_s02_p03">Jerry’s Ice Cream plans to sell 40,000 units in the first quarter, as shown in <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch09_s03_s01_f02">Figure 9.3 "Sales Budget for Jerry’s Ice Cream"</a>. For the sake of simplicity, assume work-in-process inventory is insignificant, and therefore beginning and ending work-in-process inventory is zero. (We assume beginning and ending work-in-process inventory is zero throughout this chapter.) The management prefers to maintain 10 percent of next quarter’s sales in ending inventory. Thus 4,800 units will be in inventory at the end of the first quarter (= 48,000 unit sales in second quarter × 10 percent). Units needed for the first quarter total 44,800 (= 40,000 unit sales + 4,800 units desired ending inventory). However, Jerry’s will not produce 44,800 units because inventory will be left over from the fourth quarter of last year. This beginning inventory will be 4,000 units (= 40,000 unit sales in first quarter × 10 percent). Thus actual production will total 40,800 units:</p>

Examine this figure carefully, particularly the last line labeled <em class="emphasis">units to be produced</em>. Lynn Young, the production manager, will be concerned about the spike in production during the third quarter of 59,200 units. The third quarter, from July 1 through September 30, is the peak sales season for ice cream. It will be difficult for Lynn to plan for this increase in production from the first and second quarters to the third quarter. However, this is exactly why companies prepare budgets—to plan for the future!</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch09_s03_s04_p03">Assume it takes 0.10 direct labor hours (or 6 minutes) to produce 1 unit of product.

Given an average hourly rate of $13, the direct labor cost for the first quarter totals $53,040 (= 4,080 hours × $13 per hour). This information is shown in the direct labor budget presented in <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch09_s03_s04_f01">Figure 9.6 "Direct Labor Budget for Jerry’s Ice Cream"</a>.</p>

Notice that the number of direct labor hours needed in production for the third quarter is significantly higher than each of the two previous quarters. Again, this is why organizations prepare budgets: to plan for these types of events. Lynn will have to start planning for this spike in direct labor hours, either by asking employees to work overtime or by hiring additional employees.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch09_s03_s05_p03">By definition, total variable overhead costs change with changes in production and are calculated by multiplying units to be produced by the cost per unit. For example, indirect materials cost for the first quarter of $6,120 is calculated by taking 40,800 units to be produced × $0.15 cost per unit. Fixed costs generally do <em class="emphasis">not</em> change with changes in production and therefore remain the same each quarter. (Note: In some situations, fixed overhead costs can change from one quarter to the next. For example, hiring additional salaried personnel during the year would increase fixed overhead costs, and purchasing equipment during the year would increase depreciation costs. In this example, we assume fixed overhead costs do not change during the year.)</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch09_s03_s05_p04">Depreciation is deducted at the bottom of the manufacturing overhead budget to determine cash payments for overhead because depreciation is not a cash transaction.

        <p class="para block"> </p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch09_s03_s07_p06">Answer: The budgeted income statement is perhaps the most carefully scrutinized component of the master budget. The management and employees throughout the organization use this information for planning purposes and to evaluate company performance. The board of directors and budget committee are responsible for approving the budget and often review periodic reports comparing actual net income to budgeted net income to determine if profit goals are being achieved. Lenders and owners often review the budget to ensure the organization is on track to meet its goals. The budgeted income statement answers the question: what profits does the organization expect to achieve?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch09_s03_s07_p07">After completing the budgeted income statement, only three budgets remain: the capital expenditures budget, the cash budget, and the budgeted balance sheet. We discuss the capital expenditures budget next.</p>

            <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch09_s03_s10_p04">Managers often use spreadsheets to develop operating budgets.

Notice the tabs at the bottom of the spreadsheet.
