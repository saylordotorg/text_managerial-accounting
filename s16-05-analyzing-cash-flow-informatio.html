In fact, financial results presented to the investing public typically focus on earnings per share (<a class="xref" href="heisinger_1.0-ch13#heisinger_1.0-ch13">Chapter 13 "How Do Managers Use Financial and Nonfinancial Performance Measures?"</a> discusses earnings per share in detail). However, analysis of cash flow information is becoming increasingly important to managers, auditors, and outside analysts. </em><em class="emphasis bolditalic">What measures are commonly used to evaluate performance related to cash flows?</em></p>
    <p class="para block"> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch12_s05_p02">Answer: Three common cash flow measures used to evaluate organizations are (1) operating cash flow ratio, (2) capital expenditure ratio, and (3) free cash flow. (Further coverage of these measures can be found in the following article: John R. Mills and Jeanne H. Yamamura, “The Power of Cash Flow Ratios,” <em class="emphasis">Journal of Accountancy</em>, October 1998.) We will use two large home improvement retail companies, <strong class="emphasis bold">The Home Depot, Inc.</strong>, and <strong class="emphasis bold">Lowe’s Companies, Inc.</strong>, to illustrate these measures.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch12_s05_s01_p02">Answer: This ratio measures the company’s ability to generate enough cash from daily operations over the course of a year to cover current obligations. Although similar to the commonly used current ratio, this ratio replaces current assets in the numerator with cash provided by operating activities. The operating cash flow ratio is as follows:</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch12_s05_s01_p04">As with most financial measures, the resulting ratio must be compared to similar companies in the industry to determine whether the ratio is reasonable.

        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch12_s05_s03_p02">Answer: Rather than using a ratio to determine whether the company generates enough cash from daily operations to cover capital expenditures, free cash flow is measured in dollars. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Free cash flow</a><span class="glossdef">A cash flow performance measure calculated as <em class="emphasis">cash provided by operating activities</em> minus <em class="emphasis">capital expenditures</em>.</span></span> is <em class="emphasis">cash provided by operating activities</em> minus <em class="emphasis">capital expenditures</em>. The idea is that companies must continue to invest in fixed assets to remain competitive. Free cash flow provides information regarding how much cash generated from daily operations is left over after investing in fixed assets. Many organizations, such as <strong class="emphasis bold">Amazon.com</strong>, consider this measure to be one of the most important in evaluating financial performance (see <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch12_s05_s03_n01">Note 12.34 "Business in Action 12.5"</a>). The free cash flow formula is as follows:</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch12_s05_s03_p03">The <em class="emphasis">cash provided by operating activities</em> comes from the bottom of the operating activities section of the statement of cash flows.

        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch12_s05_s03_p05">Because free cash flow for each company is above zero, both companies were able to generate enough cash from operating activities to cover investments in fixed assets and have some left over to invest elsewhere. This conclusion is consistent with the capital expenditure ratio analysis, which uses the same information to assess the company’s ability to cover fixed asset expenditures.</p>

The founder and CEO (Jeff Bezos) believes free cash flow is so important, the annual report included a letter from Mr. Bezos to the shareholders, which began with this statement, “Our ultimate financial measure, and the one we want to drive over the long-term, is free cash flow per share.”</p>
            <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch12_s05_s03_p08">The company justifies this focus on free cash flow by making the point that earnings presented on the income statement do not translate into cash flows, and shares are valued based on the present value of future cash flows. This implies shareholders should be most interested in <em class="emphasis">free cash flow per share</em> rather than <em class="emphasis">earnings per share</em>. Mr. Bezos goes on to state, “Cash flow statements often don’t receive as much attention as they deserve. Discerning investors don’t stop with the income statement.”</p>
