    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch09_p02">Many companies encounter the same issue of growing sales that is facing Jerry’s Ice Cream. Those that <em class="emphasis">plan</em> for growth have a better chance of succeeding than those that sit idle and hope it all works out. Operating budgets are used to (1) plan operations and (2) control operations. We describe both of these objectives next and then devote the remainder of this chapter to the planning phase by creating an operating budget for Jerry’s Ice Cream. We cover the control phase in <a class="xref" href="heisinger_1.0-ch10#heisinger_1.0-ch10">Chapter 10 "How Do Managers Evaluate Performance Using Cost Variance Analysis?"</a>.</p>

Assume one of your goals is to purchase a new car. It is not enough to simply state, “I want to buy a new car next year.” If you do not plan ahead for a big expense like this, you may find that you don’t have enough money for a reasonable down payment or that you have very large monthly payments. If you plan ahead, you may see that working some additional hours, cutting back on entertainment, or a combination of both, allows you to buy the car and avoid these problems. Organizations are no different, except their needs tend to be more involved. </em><em class="emphasis bolditalic">How do organizations formally plan for the future?</em></p>
    <p class="para block"> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch09_s01_p02">Answer: Let’s look at Jerry’s Ice Cream to answer this question. The company wants to increase sales next year, but will have difficulty doing this without some type of plan, often called a <em class="emphasis">budget</em>. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">budget</a><span class="glossdef">A plan of the resources needed to achieve the organization’s goals.</span></span> is a plan of the resources needed to achieve the organization’s goals.

Before presenting the detailed schedules of an operating budget, we first discuss how organizations use budgets to <em class="emphasis">plan</em> and <em class="emphasis">control</em> their activities.</p>
    <div class="section" id="heisinger_1.0-ch09_s01_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">The Planning Phase</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch09_s01_s01_p01"><em class="emphasis">Question: </em><em class="emphasis bolditalic">How are budgets used to help organizations plan future activities?</em></p>
        <p class="para block"> </p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch09_s01_s01_p02">Answer: Budgets are established in advance to help organizations communicate their plans to employees and to help employees coordinate activities across the entire organization. Imagine Jerry’s Ice Cream operating without a budget. If production has no forewarning of an increase in customer demand, Lynn Young, production manager, has no opportunity to plan for an increase in production. Inefficiencies will occur as Lynn struggles to keep pace with demand (e.g., employees working overtime or materials purchased at the last minute at a premium). Cash flow may suffer as spending initially outpaces cash receipts, which would force the company to borrow money quickly at a high interest rate. In the worst case, the company would run out of product, miss out on sales, and perhaps run out of cash.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch09_s01_s01_p03">Turn the example around and assume Jerry’s Ice Cream does have a budget in place for the coming year. The budget communicates the organization’s plans to Lynn, production manager, and Michelle, treasurer and controller, showing that sales are expected to increase. Lynn can then plan accordingly by hiring additional employees, arranging for the purchase of additional materials, and finding more space for production. Michelle can also plan accordingly by arranging for a short-term loan at a reasonable interest rate to meet short-term cash needs. As described here, the planning phase uses the budget to communicate plans to employees and to help employees coordinate activities across the organization.</p>

        <p class="para block"> </p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch09_s01_s02_p02">Answer: Organizations use budgets to evaluate performance. By comparing the budget with actual results, companies can determine whether employees, and the company as a whole, have performed as expected.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch09_s01_s02_p03">For example, assume Jerry’s Ice Cream estimates sales for the first quarter of next year will be 40,000 units at $6 per unit. Actual sales turn out to be 38,000 units at $6.20 per unit. The company can evaluate sales manager Tom Benson’s performance by comparing the budget to actual results. For unit sales, Tom did not perform as well as expected (38,000 units actually sold versus 40,000 in budgeted unit sales). However, Tom exceeded expectations for sales price ($6.20 per unit actual sales price versus budgeted sales price of $6).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch09_s01_s02_p04">The next chapter covers the <em class="emphasis">control</em> phase of budgeting in depth. We now turn to the process of creating an operating budget to plan a company’s operations for the coming year. Creating an operating budget is an essential part of business. Depending on the type of product offered and the size of the company, operating budgets vary widely in complexity. International companies in particular face difficult hurdles when it comes to budgeting, as described in <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch09_s01_s02_n01">Note 9.4 "Business in Action 9.1"</a>.</p>

            <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch09_s01_s02_p05">Companies with operations in several different countries, called <em class="emphasis">multinational companies</em>, face numerous challenges in establishing operating budgets. Most experts agree that foreign exchange rates have the biggest impact on budgeting for multinationals. Specific exchange rates are used when the budget is established. However, these rates can fluctuate significantly and are likely to differ when companies compare actual results with the initial budget. This makes the budget control process difficult because exchange rate variations might cause the differences between actual results and the budget.</p>
            <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch09_s01_s02_p06">Exchange rate fluctuations, along with other market characteristics—such as economic uncertainty and unpredictable government activities—make budgeting for multinational companies a challenging task.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch09_s02_p02">Answer: Successful companies approach budgeting from the bottom up. This requires the involvement of various employees within the organization, not just upper management. Lower-level employees often know more about their functional areas than upper management, and they can be an excellent source of information for budgeting purposes. Although getting input from employees throughout the organization can be time consuming, this approach tends to increase employee motivation and acceptance of the budget.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch09_s03_p02">Answer: Study <a class="xref" href="heisinger_1.0-ch09_s02#heisinger_1.0-ch09_s02_f01">Figure 9.1 "Master Budget Schedules"</a> carefully, as it serves as the road map for the master budget presented throughout this chapter for Jerry’s Ice Cream. Notice that the budgeting process starts with the sales budget. Also, note that the budgets described next are for a manufacturing company. Manufacturing companies tend to have more budget schedules than other types of organizations because their operations are more complex. Once you understand budgeting in a manufacturing environment, you can easily modify the process to perform budgeting in other organizations, as discussed later in the chapter. As we work through the master budget for Jerry’s Ice Cream, assume the company prepares quarterly budgets.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch09_s03_s01_p03">Forecasting sales often involves extensive research and numerous sources. Companies, such as Jerry’s Ice Cream, typically start with their sales staff since salespeople have daily contact with customers and direct information about customer demand. Some companies pay for market trend data to learn about industry and product trends. Many organizations hire market research consultants to obtain and review industry data and ultimately to predict customer demand. Larger companies sometimes employ economists to develop sophisticated models used to project sales. Smaller, less sophisticated organizations simply base their estimates on past trends. <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch09_s03_s01_f01">Figure 9.2 "Estimating Sales"</a> shows how companies obtain sales information from sales people, market research consultants, and economists.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch09_s03_s01_p04">Tom Benson, sales manager at Jerry’s Ice Cream, talked with his salespeople and reviewed market trends for ice cream using data obtained from a market research firm. His estimate, shown in <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch09_s03_s01_f02">Figure 9.3 "Sales Budget for Jerry’s Ice Cream"</a>, assumes the company will increase sales 15 percent this coming year. Thus, to get projected sales for quarter 1, Tom simply multiplied last year’s first quarter sales by 1.15. The average price per unit last year was $6 (1 unit = 1 gallon), and Tom does not expect any change in this price. The sales budget is presented in <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch09_s03_s01_f02">Figure 9.3 "Sales Budget for Jerry’s Ice Cream"</a>.</p>

For the sake of simplicity, assume work-in-process inventory is insignificant, and therefore beginning and ending work-in-process inventory is zero. (We assume beginning and ending work-in-process inventory is zero throughout this chapter.) The management prefers to maintain 10 percent of next quarter’s sales in ending inventory. Thus 4,800 units will be in inventory at the end of the first quarter (= 48,000 unit sales in second quarter × 10 percent). Units needed for the first quarter total 44,800 (= 40,000 unit sales + 4,800 units desired ending inventory). However, Jerry’s will not produce 44,800 units because inventory will be left over from the fourth quarter of last year.

Knowing Jerry’s Ice Cream plans to produce 40,800 units of ice cream during the first quarter, this budget answers the questions: how many direct labor hours will be necessary to achieve this production, and what will this labor cost?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch09_s03_s04_p03">Assume it takes 0.10 direct labor hours (or 6 minutes) to produce 1 unit of product. Thus 4,080 hours of direct labor will be required to produce 40,800 units of product (= 40,800 finished units produced × 0.10 direct labor hours per unit). Given an average hourly rate of $13, the direct labor cost for the first quarter totals $53,040 (= 4,080 hours × $13 per hour). This information is shown in the direct labor budget presented in <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch09_s03_s04_f01">Figure 9.6 "Direct Labor Budget for Jerry’s Ice Cream"</a>.</p>

The production manager at Jerry’s Ice Cream, Lynn Young, uses this information to ensure the appropriate number of employees is available to meet production goals. Notice that the number of direct labor hours needed in production for the third quarter is significantly higher than each of the two previous quarters. Again, this is why organizations prepare budgets: to plan for these types of events. Lynn will have to start planning for this spike in direct labor hours, either by asking employees to work overtime or by hiring additional employees.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch09_s03_s05_p03">By definition, total variable overhead costs change with changes in production and are calculated by multiplying units to be produced by the cost per unit. For example, indirect materials cost for the first quarter of $6,120 is calculated by taking 40,800 units to be produced × $0.15 cost per unit. Fixed costs generally do <em class="emphasis">not</em> change with changes in production and therefore remain the same each quarter. (Note: In some situations, fixed overhead costs can change from one quarter to the next. For example, hiring additional salaried personnel during the year would increase fixed overhead costs, and purchasing equipment during the year would increase depreciation costs. In this example, we assume fixed overhead costs do not change during the year.)</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch09_s03_s05_p04">Depreciation is deducted at the bottom of the manufacturing overhead budget to determine cash payments for overhead because depreciation is not a cash transaction.

The management and employees throughout the organization use this information for planning purposes and to evaluate company performance. The board of directors and budget committee are responsible for approving the budget and often review periodic reports comparing actual net income to budgeted net income to determine if profit goals are being achieved. Lenders and owners often review the budget to ensure the organization is on track to meet its goals. The budgeted income statement answers the question: what profits does the organization expect to achieve?</p>

            <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch09_s03_s10_p04">Managers often use spreadsheets to develop operating budgets.

        <p class="para block"> </p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch09_s04_s02_p02">Answer: Service organizations, such as architectural and accounting firms, provide services rather than tangible goods. These organizations do not have raw materials, finished goods, or merchandise inventories, and therefore they do not have production or merchandise purchases budgets. Instead, the focus is on projected sales revenue from services provided and the labor necessary to achieve sales revenue projections. Service organizations must constantly estimate services to be provided and make sure labor force resources are available to meet customer demand.</p>

        <p class="para block"> </p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch09_s04_s03_p02">Answer: Because not-for-profit organizations are very diverse in nature—for example, some provide a service, while others collect money to help victims of natural disasters or to promote medical research—it is difficult to generalize about which master budget components apply and which do not. However, with an understanding of the budget components used by manufacturing, merchandising, and service organizations, one can establish a budgeting process for virtually any not-for-profit organization. For an example of how one not-for-profit organization goes about the budgeting process, read <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch09_s04_s03_n01">Note 9.35 "Business in Action 9.3"</a>.</p>

            <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch09_s04_s03_p03">Yearly, a small not-for-profit symphony in California establishes an operating budget with revenues totaling $200,000. The symphony’s treasurer oversees the budget committee, which is made up of three board members. The budget committee is responsible for creating, approving, and monitoring the budget.</p>
            <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch09_s04_s03_p04">The budget committee begins the budgeting process by reviewing information from the year before. All board members and office staff are given spreadsheets showing last year’s results and are asked to provide input for the next budget period. For example, the committee responsible for ticket sales estimates sales revenue based on expected ticket sales times the average sales price. Anticipated increases in sales price are considered in the sales budget.</p>
            <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch09_s04_s03_p05">Expenses are also budgeted based on last year’s actual results. Those requesting increases in budgeted expenditures must justify them. Once revenues and expenses are established for the next budget period, the bookkeeper enters the information using QuickBooks software and prints a preliminary budget report, which the budget committee reviews. Once the budget committee has balanced the budget, reviewed it for reasonableness, and approved it, it goes to the board of directors for approval.</p>
            <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch09_s04_s03_p06">The control phase of the budgeting process requires that all expenditures be in accordance with the budget. Any expenditure exceeding the budget by more than $25 must be approved by the board of directors. A financial report comparing <em class="emphasis">actual</em> revenues and expenditures with <em class="emphasis">budgeted</em> revenues and expenditures (produced using QuickBooks software) is submitted to the board of directors monthly.</p>

        </ol>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch09_s05_p01"><em class="emphasis">Question: Although bottom-up budgeting, in which management elicits input from employees throughout the company, is effective in actively engaging those who have to achieve the budgeted goals, this type of budgeting is not free from problems. Ethical issues often arise in the budgeting process, particularly when employees and managers are evaluated by comparing their actual results to the budget. </em><em class="emphasis bolditalic">How might ethical issues arise in the budgeting process?</em></p>
    <p class="para block"> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch09_s05_p02">Answer: To demonstrate how ethical dilemmas might arise, assume you are a manager and you help upper management establish the master budget (this is the planning phase). Furthermore, you are evaluated based on achieving budgeted profit on a quarterly basis (this is the control phase). In fact, you will receive a $10,000 quarterly bonus, in addition to your base salary, if you meet or exceed budgeted profit. There is an inherent conflict between the planning and control phases of this process. You are helping the company plan, but you also want to be sure budgeted profit is as low as possible so you can get the $10,000 bonus.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch09_s05_p03">Establishing a sales and profit budget that is considerably lower than what will likely happen causes problems for the entire organization. Production may be short of materials and labor, causing inefficiencies in the production process. Selling and administrative support may be lacking due to underestimating sales. Customers will not be satisfied if they must wait for the product. The dilemma you face as a manager in this situation is whether to do what is best for you (set a low profit estimate to earn the bonus) or do what is best for the company (estimate accurately so the budget reflects true sales and production needs).</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch09_s05_p04">Organizations must recognize this conflict and have processes in place to ensure both the interests of individual employees and the interests of the organization as a whole are served. For example, employees can be rewarded not just for meeting goals but also for providing accurate estimates. Perhaps a long-term stock option incentive system would provide motivation to do what is best for the organization, thereby increasing shareholder value. Whatever incentive system is implemented, organizations must promote honest employee input and beware of fraudulent reporting to achieve financial targets.</p>

            <li>An inherent conflict often exists between the planning and control phases of budgeting. During the planning phase, organizations are most concerned about getting accurate estimates that lead to positive results. The control phase requires evaluating performance of employees by comparing actual results to the operating budget. Employees often must decide between doing what is best for the individual employee and what is best for the organization.</li>

        <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch09_s05_p05">Assume you are the manager of the computer division of High Tech Retail, Inc.

        <p class="simpara">Solution to Review Problem 9.9</p>
        <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch09_s05_p07">Employees who are evaluated in the control phase by comparing actual results to budgeted information have an incentive to create a budget that is easy to achieve, and perhaps unrealistic. This can create problems for the organization as a whole since inventory purchases are made based on budgeted sales. If each of the division managers submits a sales budget that significantly underestimates sales, the company will likely have a shortage of inventory and lose out on sales as customers go elsewhere to find the product. Although the managers will have an easier time achieving sales and profit goals, the company as a whole will suffer. The ethical dilemma of choosing between doing what is best for the division manager and what is best for the organization can ultimately lead to lower sales and dissatisfied customers.</p>
