    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch02_p01">Dan Stevens recently started Custom Furniture Company, a manufacturing company that specializes in building custom wood tables for individuals and organizations. Each table is unique and built to customer specifications for use in homes (coffee tables and dining room tables) and offices (boardroom and meeting room tables). The sales price of each table varies significantly, from $1,000 to more than $30,000. (Note that this is the same company as the example in the last part of <a class="xref" href="heisinger_1.0-ch01#heisinger_1.0-ch01">Chapter 1 "What Is Managerial Accounting?"</a>. Although not required, you may find it helpful to refer to the <a class="xref" href="heisinger_1.0-ch01#heisinger_1.0-ch01">Chapter 1 "What Is Managerial Accounting?"</a> discussion of Custom Furniture Company.)</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch02_p02">When Dan received the company’s income statement for May, he was surprised by the lack of profits. Because sales prices are based on a markup of estimated costs, Dan is questioning the accuracy of his estimates. He approaches Leslie, the full-time accountant for Custom Furniture Company, to get more information.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch02_s01_s01_p03">Tracking revenues and costs for each job is important for several reasons:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch02_s01_s01_l01">
            <li>Like Dan at Custom Furniture, managers want to assess the accuracy of cost estimates. This is particularly important when prices are based on estimated costs.</li>
            <li>Managers want to review actual revenues and costs for each job to see if the job is profitable.</li>
            <li>Managers want to compare actual costs with estimated costs throughout a project so they can identify unexpected changes as early in the project as possible. For example, if the cost of mahogany wood increases by 50 percent, Custom Furniture might renegotiate the price of a mahogany table with the customer. If it’s too late to renegotiate the price of a current job, the cost increase could be built into the pricing of future jobs.</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch02_s03_s02_p02">Answer: Companies use normal costing for several reasons:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch02_s03_s02_l01">
            <li>Actual overhead costs can fluctuate from month to month, causing high amounts of overhead to be charged to jobs during high-cost periods. For example, utility costs might be higher during cold winter months and hot summer months than in the fall and spring seasons. Maintenance costs might be higher during slow periods. Normal costing averages these costs out over the course of a year.</li>
            <li>Actual overhead cost data are typically only available at the end of the month, quarter, or year. Managers prefer to know the cost of a job when it is completed—and in some cases during production—rather than waiting until the end of the period.</li>
            <li>The price charged to customers is often negotiated based on cost. A predetermined overhead rate is helpful when estimating costs.</li>
            <li>Bookkeeping is simplified by using a predetermined overhead rate. One rate is used to record overhead costs rather than tabulating actual overhead costs at the end of the reporting period and going back to assign the costs to jobs.</li>

            <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch02_s03_s04_p06">Since most of <strong class="emphasis bold">Boeing’s</strong> products are unique and costly, the company likely uses job costing to track costs associated with each product it manufactures. For example, the costly direct materials that go into each jetliner produced are tracked using a job cost sheet. Direct labor and manufacturing overhead costs (think huge production facilities!) are also assigned to each jetliner. This careful tracking of production costs for each jetliner provides management with important cost information that is used to assess production efficiency and profitability. Management can answer questions, such as “How much did direct materials cost?,” “How much overhead was allocated to each jetliner?,” or “What was the total production cost for each jetliner?” This is important information when it comes time to negotiate the sales price of a jetliner with a potential buyer like <strong class="emphasis bold">United Airlines</strong> or <strong class="emphasis bold">Southwest Airlines</strong>.</p>

        <p class="para block"> </p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch02_s04_s01_p02">Answer: Many service organizations do not track direct materials for each job because the cost of the materials is negligible. For example, accountants and attorneys use low-cost materials, such as binders and paper. These materials, often called supplies, are included in overhead rather than tracked by job.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch02_s04_s01_p03">Some service organizations track direct materials for each job because the cost of the materials is significant. Consider auto mechanics, who track the parts needed to perform repairs for each job, or electricians, who track the materials needed to wire a new building. Materials may be requisitioned from parts inventory or supplies, similar to raw materials inventory in a manufacturing setting, or may be purchased directly from a supplier, depending on the nature of the business. The process of recording this information in the journal and job cost sheet is exactly the same as for a manufacturing company (refer back to <a class="xref" href="heisinger_1.0-ch02_s02#heisinger_1.0-ch02_s02_s03_f01">Figure 2.3 "Job Cost Sheet for Custom Furniture Company"</a> for an example).</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch02_s04_s03_p02">Answer: Because overhead is typically driven by direct labor hours in a service organization, direct labor hours or direct labor cost is the most common allocation base.

            <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch02_s04_s03_p03">Studios that produce costly movies, such as <strong class="emphasis bold">20th Century Fox</strong>, <strong class="emphasis bold">Universal Studios</strong>, and <strong class="emphasis bold">Warner Brothers</strong>, incur a variety of costs that are tracked using a job costing system. For example, the production of a Harry Potter movie requires direct labor in the form of actors, directors, editors, and the film crew. The direct materials category includes costumes, extensive sets, and props. Overhead costs include items such as depreciation of film production equipment, utilities in the editing studio, and executive salaries for those overseeing the production of several films concurrently.</p>
            <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch02_s04_s03_p04">Determining the production costs of movies and related profitability is important for this industry since actors, directors, and others involved in the film are often compensated based on a percentage of profits. Disagreements sometimes arise between studios and actors regarding the accuracy of costs for movies, particularly in the area of overhead. Some studios have been accused of allocating too much overhead to individual films to drive down the reported profitability of each film, thereby reducing the amount owed to those receiving a portion of the profits.</p>

                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Direct materials.</strong> The cost of direct materials for many service companies, such as accounting and law firms, is insignificant. These companies therefore do not track direct materials for each job. However, service companies that use costly materials, such as an auto repair shop, do track direct materials for each job. Because direct materials tend to be costly for manufacturing firms, these firms typically track direct materials for each job.</li>

<strong class="emphasis bold">Direct labor.</strong> Because direct labor tends to be the most significant cost for service companies, these companies track costs by job using a timesheet and job cost sheet, just as manufacturing companies do.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Overhead.</strong> Service and manufacturing firms track overhead costs in a similar way. Both often use a predetermined overhead rate to charge overhead costs to jobs. Because overhead is typically driven by direct labor hours in a service company, direct labor hours are often used as the allocation base.

        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch02_s05_s02_p03">Answer: This information helps managers assess the profitability of individual jobs. Custom Furniture Company was able to identify areas of concern by comparing information from job cost sheets with Dan’s estimates. Dan and Leslie will have to do more research to find the cause of the high material costs. If changes cannot be made to the production process to reduce these costs, Dan may have to consider revising his estimates and raising prices on future jobs. The goal is to provide enough information for the company to make informed decisions about areas of concern, such as direct materials costs, and how much to charge for future jobs.</p>
