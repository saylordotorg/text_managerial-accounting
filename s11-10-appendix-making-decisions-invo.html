    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch07_s10_p02">Answer: Suppose Oregon Lumber Company takes a log (the single input) and mills it into two types of products: high quality Grade A lumber, and lower quality Grade B lumber.

        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch07_s10_s02_p06">The sales value method assumes that profit as a percent of sales will remain the same across all products. For example, <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch07_s10_s02_f01">Figure 7.19 "Joint Product Profitability for Oregon Lumber Company: Sales"</a> shows that Grade A lumber has a profit margin ratio of 16.67 percent (= $40,000 profit ÷ $240,000 sales), as does Grade B lumber (= $10,000 profit ÷ $60,000 sales). This method also ensures that joint costs allocated to each product will not exceed sales revenue for each product (unless total joint costs are higher than total revenue).</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch07_s10_s03_p01"><em class="emphasis">Question: Assume Oregon Lumber Company has the option of processing Grade B lumber further into a finished product by sanding the lumber and painting it with primer. This option is presented in <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch07_s10_s03_f01">Figure 7.20 "Further Processing of Oregon Lumber Company’s Grade B Lumber"</a>. The sanded and painted Grade B lumber sells for $0.45 per board foot rather than $0.30 for the unfinished Grade B lumber. The additional cost to sand and paint the Grade B lumber is $0.05 per board foot. </em><em class="emphasis bolditalic">Should Oregon Lumber process Grade B lumber further into finished lumber?</em></p>

        <p class="para block"> </p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch07_s10_s03_p02">Answer: The answer depends on whether the additional revenue exceeds the additional cost of processing Grade B lumber further. Since the additional revenue of $0.15 per board foot (= $0.45 finished price − $0.30 unfinished price) is greater than the additional $0.05 per board foot processing cost, Oregon Lumber should process the Grade B lumber further into finished lumber. Profit increases $0.10 per board foot as a result of processing further (= $0.15 additional revenue − $0.05 additional cost).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch07_s10_s03_p03">Oregon Lumber will decide whether or not to process Grade B lumber further regardless of how joint costs are allocated to Grade A and Grade B lumber. In a sense, joint costs are sunk costs with respect to this decision, and will not influence future processing decisions. Thus joint costs incurred <em class="emphasis">prior</em> to the split-off point are irrelevant to the decision whether to process further <em class="emphasis">after</em> the split-off point.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Key Takeaway</h3>
            <ul class="itemizedlist" id="heisinger_1.0-ch07_s10_s03_l01">
                <li>Two or more products made from a single input are called joint products. The costs of the single input and related manufacturing process costs must be allocated to each of the joint products. The physical quantities method allocates joint costs based on a physical measure of output (e.g., pounds or yards of material). The sales value method allocates joint costs based on the relative sales value for each of the joint products. Regardless of the allocation method used, total joint costs and total profit remain the same. Companies must often decide whether to process a joint product further. If as a result of processing the product further, additional sales revenue exceeds additional costs, the wise decision is to process further.</li>

Allocated fixed costs are assigned to product lines based on direct labor hours associated with each product line resulting in the following percentages for soda, sports drink, and lemonade, respectively: 25 percent, 20 percent, and 55 percent. If the sports drink and lemonade product lines are eliminated, total allocated fixed costs will decrease by $40,000, and variable costs and direct fixed costs for these two product lines will be eliminated. (No allocated fixed cost savings occur if only one product line is dropped.)</p>
