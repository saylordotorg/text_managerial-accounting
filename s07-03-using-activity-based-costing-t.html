    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch03_s03_p02">Answer: <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Activity-based costing (ABC)</a><span class="glossdef">A method of costing that uses several cost pools, and therefore several predetermined overhead rates, organized by activity to allocate overhead costs.</span></span> uses several cost pools, organized by <em class="emphasis">activity</em>, to allocate overhead costs. (Remember that plantwide allocation uses one cost pool for the whole plant, and department allocation uses one cost pool for each department.) The idea is that activities are required to produce products—activities such as purchasing materials, setting up machinery, assembling products, and inspecting finished products. These activities can be costly. Thus the cost of activities should be allocated to products based on the products’ use of the activities.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch03_s03_s01_p01">Five steps are required to implement activity-based costing. As you work through the example for SailRite Company, once again note that total estimated overhead costs remain at $8,000,000. However, the total is broken out into different <em class="emphasis">activities</em> rather than <em class="emphasis">departments</em>, and an overhead rate is established for each activity. The five steps are as follows:</p>

The goal is to understand all the activities required to make the company’s products. This requires interviewing and meeting with personnel throughout the organization. Companies that use activity-based costing, such as <strong class="emphasis bold">Hewlett Packard</strong> and <strong class="emphasis bold">IBM</strong>, may identify hundreds of activities required to make their products. The most challenging part of this step is narrowing down the activities to those that have the biggest impact on overhead costs.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch03_s03_s01_p04">After meeting with personnel throughout the company, SailRite’s accountant identified the following activities as having the biggest impact on overhead costs:</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch03_s03_s01_p06">This step requires that overhead costs associated with each activity be assigned to the activity (i.e., a cost pool is formed for each activity). For SailRite, the cost pool for the purchasing materials activity will include costs for items such as salaries of purchasing personnel, rent for purchasing department office space, and depreciation of purchasing office equipment.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch03_s03_s01_p07">The accountant at SailRite developed the following allocations after careful review of all overhead costs (remember, these are <em class="emphasis">overhead</em> costs, not direct materials or direct labor costs):</p>

Therefore the Deluxe model was allocated 20 percent of all overhead costs. Using activity-based costing, we identified five key activities and assigned overhead costs based on the use of these activities. The Deluxe process consumed more than 20 percent of the resources provided for every activity. For example, running machines is one of the most costly activities, and the Deluxe model used about 44 percent of the resources provided by this activity.

Let’s look at <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch03_s03_s01_s02_f02">Figure 3.8 "Detailed Analysis of Overhead Allocations at SailRite Company"</a> in detail:</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch03_s03_s01_s02_p04">The primary reason that using activity-based costing shifted overhead costs to the Deluxe sailboat is that producing each Deluxe boat requires more resources than the Basic boat. For example, the Basic boat requires 50,000 machine hours to produce 5,000 boats, and the Deluxe boat requires 40,000 machine hours to produce 1,000 boats. The number of machine hours required per boat produced is as follows:</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Advantages</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch03_s03_s02_s01_p01"><strong class="emphasis bold">More accurate cost information leads to better decisions.</strong> The cost information provided by ABC is generally regarded as more accurate than the information provided by most traditional costing methods. This allows management to make better decisions in areas such as product pricing, product line changes (adding products or eliminating products), and product mix decisions (how much of each product to produce and sell).</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch03_s03_s02_s01_p02"><strong class="emphasis bold">Increased knowledge of production activities leads to process improvements and reduced costs.</strong> ABC requires identifying the activities involved in the production process (step 1) and assigning costs to these activities (step 2). This provides management with a better view of the detailed activities involved (purchasing materials, machine setups, inspections, and so forth) and the cost of each activity. Managers are more likely to focus on improving efficiency in the most costly activities, thereby reducing costs.</p>

        <div class="section" id="heisinger_1.0-ch03_s03_s02_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Disadvantages</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch03_s03_s02_s02_p01"><strong class="emphasis bold">ABC systems can be costly to implement.</strong> ABC systems require teamwork across the organization and therefore require employees to take time out from their day-to-day activities to assist in the ABC process (e.g., to identify costly activities). Assigning costs to activities takes time, as does identifying and tracking cost drivers. And assigning costs to products requires a significant amount of time in the accounting department. Imagine having 15 cost pools (activities), each with a predetermined overhead rate used to assign overhead costs to the company’s 80 products—not an unrealistic example for a large company. The accounting costs incurred to maintain such a system can be prohibitively high.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch03_s03_s02_s02_p02"><strong class="emphasis bold">Unitizing fixed costs can be misleading.</strong> Product costing involves allocating costs from activity centers to products and calculating a product cost per unit. The problem with this approach is that fixed costs are often a large part of the overhead costs being allocated (e.g., building and machinery depreciation and supervisor salaries). Recall that fixed costs are costs that <em class="emphasis">do not change in total</em> with changes in activity.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch03_s03_s02_s02_p03">Looking back to the SailRite example using activity-based costing, the Deluxe sailboat cost $5,030 per unit to produce based on production of 1,000 units (as shown in <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch03_s03_s01_f02">Figure 3.5 "Allocation of Overhead Costs to Products at SailRite Company"</a>). If SailRite produces 2,000 units of the Deluxe boat, will the unit cost remain at $5,030? Probably not. A significant portion of overhead costs are fixed and will be spread out over more units, thereby reducing the cost per unit. We address this issue at length in later chapters. The point here is that managers must beware of using per unit cost information blindly for decision making, particularly if a significant change in the level of production is anticipated.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch03_s03_s02_s02_p04"><strong class="emphasis bold">The benefits may not outweigh the costs.</strong> Companies with one or two products that require very little variation in production may not benefit from an ABC system. Suppose a company produces one product. The overhead costs can be divided into as many cost pools as you like, but all overhead costs will still be assigned to the one product. (We should mention, however, that management would benefit from understanding the activities involved in the process and the costs associated with each activity. It’s the allocation to the one product—steps 4 and 5 of ABC—that would provide little useful information in this scenario.)</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch03_s03_s02_s02_p05">Companies that produce several different products may believe that the benefits of implementing ABC will outweigh the costs. However, management must be willing to use the ABC information to benefit the company. Companies like <strong class="emphasis bold">Chrysler Group LLC</strong> have been known to try ABC, only to meet resistance from their managers. Until managers are willing to use the ABC information to make improvements in the organization, there is no point in implementing such a system.</p>

                <li>Activity-based costing focuses on identifying the activities required to make products, on forming cost pools for each activity, and on allocating overhead costs to the products based on their use of each activity. ABC systems and traditional systems often result in vastly different product costs. But even if the resulting product costs are not much different, ABC provides managers with a better understanding of the production activities required for each activity and the associated costs, which often leads to improved efficiency and reduced costs.</li>

            <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch03_s03_s04_p03"><strong class="emphasis bold">BuyGasCo Corporation</strong>, a privately owned chain of gas stations based in Florida, was taken to court for selling regular grade gasoline below cost, and an injunction was issued. Florida law prohibits selling gasoline below refinery cost if doing so injures competition. Using a plantwide approach of allocating costs to products, the plaintiff’s costing expert was able to support the allegation of predatory pricing. The defendant’s expert witness, an accounting professor, used activity-based costing to dispute the allegation.</p>
            <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch03_s03_s04_p04">Both costing experts had to allocate costs to each of the three grades of gasoline (regular, plus, and premium) to determine a total cost per grade of fuel and a cost per gallon for each grade. Sales of regular grade fuel were significantly higher (63 percent of total sales) than the other two grades. Using the plantwide approach, the plaintiff‘s expert allocated all costs based on gallons of gas sold. Using the activity-based costing approach, the defendant‘s expert formed three activity cost pools—labor, kiosk, and gas dispensing. The first two cost pools allocated costs using gallons of gas sold and therefore were allocated as they would be with the plantwide approach (63 percent for regular grade, 20 percent for plus, and 17 percent for premium). The third cost pool (gas dispensing) allocated costs equally to each grade of fuel (i.e., one-third of costs to each grade of fuel). The gas dispensing pool included costs for storage tanks, all of which were the same size, as well as gas pumps and signs.</p>
            <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch03_s03_s04_p05">Compared with the plantwide approach, activity-based costing showed a lower cost per gallon for regular gas and a higher cost per gallon for the other two grades of fuel. Once the ABC information was presented, the case was settled, and the initial injunction was lifted.</p>

            <p class="para" id="heisinger_1.0-ch03_s03_s04_p06">Parker Company produces an inkjet printer that sells for $150 and a laser printer that sells for $350. Last year, total overhead costs of $1,050,000 were allocated based on direct labor hours. A total of 15,000 direct labor hours were required last year to build 12,000 inkjet printers (1.25 hours per unit), and 10,000 direct labor hours were required to build 4,000 laser printers (2.50 hours per unit). Total direct labor and direct materials costs for the year were as follows:</p>
