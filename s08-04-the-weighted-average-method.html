Thus 9,000 units must be accounted for. These 9,000 units will end up in one of two places, either completed and transferred out (to the Finishing department) or not completed and therefore in ending WIP inventory.

The 4,000 units transferred out are 100 percent complete for direct materials, direct labor, and overhead (otherwise, they would not be transferred out), which results in equivalent units matching the physical units.
