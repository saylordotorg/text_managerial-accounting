Rather than establishing one standard variable overhead rate and standard quantity based on one cost driver, activity-based costing establishes several standard variable overhead rates and quantities, each having its own cost driver. </em><em class="emphasis bolditalic">How would variance analysis be implemented for a company that uses activity-based costing?</em></p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch10_s07_p02">Answer: Regardless of whether a company uses the traditional costing approach or an activity-based costing approach, the process of performing variance analysis is the same. Similar to the traditional costing approach, the variable overhead <em class="emphasis">spending variance</em> for activity-based costing is calculated <em class="emphasis">for each activity</em> as follows:</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch10_s07_p06">Recall that Jerry’s produced 210,000 units for the year. <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch10_s07_f01">Figure 10.11 "Variable Overhead Variance Analysis for Jerry’s Ice Cream Using Activity-Based Costing"</a> shows the resulting variable overhead variance analysis. Notice that the format for <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch10_s07_f01">Figure 10.11 "Variable Overhead Variance Analysis for Jerry’s Ice Cream Using Activity-Based Costing"</a> is the same as for <a class="xref" href="heisinger_1.0-ch10_s05#heisinger_1.0-ch10_s05_f01">Figure 10.8 "Variable Manufacturing Overhead Variance Analysis for Jerry’s Ice Cream"</a>. The variance calculations are also the same except variances are calculated for three activities rather than one. Note that total actual variable overhead costs remain at $100,000, but they are simply broken out into 3 activities ($100,000 = $42,000 for purchase orders + $31,000 for product testing + $27,000 for energy costs). Also, the flexible budget presented in <a class="xref" href="#heisinger_1.0-ch10_s07_f01">Figure 10.11 "Variable Overhead Variance Analysis for Jerry’s Ice Cream Using Activity-Based Costing"</a>, totaling $115,500, differs from the flexible budget presented earlier since Jerry’s is using a different cost system in this example, which often results in different budgeted amounts ($115,500 = $52,500 purchase orders + $42,000 product testing + $21,000 energy).</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch10_s07_p07">This type of costing system and resulting variance analysis provides management with further information regarding variable overhead costs and variances. As discussed earlier, management often establishes criteria to decide which variances to investigate. Assume that management of Jerry’s Ice Cream chooses to investigate the $7,750 unfavorable efficiency variance associated with energy. The management would like to know why 575,000 minutes of actual machine time were used instead of the expected 420,000 minutes. Perhaps the machines were operating poorly due to cutbacks in maintenance, or maybe new employees were not as efficient using the machines. Whatever the cause, Jerry’s has identified the issue by integrating its activity-based costing system with the cost variance analysis concepts discussed in this chapter.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Key Takeaway</h3>
        <ul class="itemizedlist" id="heisinger_1.0-ch10_s07_l02">
            <li>Using cost variance analysis with activity-based costing is much like using cost variance analysis with traditional costing. Both utilize a spending variance and an efficiency variance. However, activity-based costing requires calculating a spending and efficiency variance for each activity rather than only one activity base typically used in traditional costing.</li>
