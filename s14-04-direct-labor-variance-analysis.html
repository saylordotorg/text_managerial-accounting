        <p class="para editable block" id="heisinger_1.0-ch10_s04_s04_p03">As stated earlier, variance analysis is the <em class="emphasis">control</em> phase of budgeting. Using variance analysis for direct materials and direct labor, Jerry’s Ice Cream was able to identify strong points in its operations (quantity of materials used and efficiency of direct labor workforce), and perhaps more important, Jerry’s was able to identify problem areas (price paid for materials and wages paid to employees). This information gives the management a way to monitor and control production costs. Next, we calculate and analyze variable manufacturing overhead cost variances.</p>
